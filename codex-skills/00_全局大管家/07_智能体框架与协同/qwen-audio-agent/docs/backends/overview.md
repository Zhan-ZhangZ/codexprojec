# Backend Agent

The Backend Agent handles tasks that require tools, file operations, or sustained processing. When the frontend voice LLM determines that a request needs execution, it delegates the goal to the Backend Agent for asynchronous execution; once the result is ready, it naturally returns to the current conversation.

## Supported Agents

| Backend Agent | Integration Method | Setup Requirements | Skills | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | N/A | Frontend-only mode, no configuration needed | — | ★★★★★ |
| Qwen Code | Native ACP | Supports one-click install, requires user configuration | `~/.qwen/skills/` | ★★★★★ |
| OpenCode | Native ACP | Supports one-click install and Bailian configuration | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | ★★★★★ |
| OpenClaw | Built-in ACP bridge | Supports one-click install and Bailian configuration | `~/.openclaw/skills/` | ★★★★★ |
| Qoder | Native ACP | Supports one-click install, requires user configuration | `~/.qoder/skills/` | ★★★★★ |
| MiniMax Code | Native ACP | Supports one-click install, requires user configuration | Managed by MiniMax Code | ★★★★☆ |
| Kimi Code | Native ACP | Supports one-click install, requires user configuration | `~/.agents/skills/` | ★★★★★ |
| Hermes | Native ACP | Supports one-click install, requires user configuration | `~/.hermes/skills/` | ★★★★☆ |
| CodeBuddy | Native ACP | Supports one-click install, requires user configuration | `~/.codebuddy/skills/` | ★★★★☆ |
| Codex | External ACP adapter | Supports one-click install of both the core and adapter, requires user configuration | `~/.codex/skills/` | ★★★★☆ |
| Claude Code | External ACP adapter | Supports one-click install of both the core and adapter, requires user configuration | `~/.claude/skills/` | ★★★★☆ |
| DeepSeek | Native ACP | Supports one-click install, requires a DeepSeek API key | `~/.agents/skills/` | ★★★★☆ |
| Pi | External ACP adapter | Supports one-click install of both the core and adapter, requires user configuration | `~/.pi/agent/skills/` | ★★★★☆ |
| Muse Code | Native MSP adapter | Muse and SDK installed on demand, requires user configuration | Managed by Muse Code | Experimental |

Skills install once through `qwenaudio skill install` (a branded entry point
for the standard skills.sh installer) and land automatically in the user-level
directories of backends that declare a skills.sh installer above. MiniMax Code
and Muse Code manage their own extension systems. See
[Skill Management](../guides/skills.md).

The recommendation rating reflects the current integration completeness, compatibility, and extent of real-world verification: five stars indicates a fully tested and recommended integration, while four stars indicates ongoing development or incomplete verification of the same scope.

## One-Click Install

Uninstalled backend agents can be installed locally with a unified command:

```bash
qwenaudio install codex
qwenaudio install deepseek
qwenaudio install minimax
qwenaudio install muse
```

Before installation, a detection step runs to **only fill in missing components**: it installs the backend core and, where required, its adapter. Existing components are not reinstalled. Installation does not mean the backend is configured: complete any login and configuration required by the selected backend. In the desktop settings page's "Backend Agent" list, an "Install" button appears at the end of rows for uninstalled backends that support one-click install, using the same installation logic as the CLI.

Existing local Agents and their configuration take priority. Installation only
adds missing hosts or adapters, using the official `latest` tag for npm packages.
It does not upgrade or downgrade existing installations. When only the ACP adapter
is missing, the desktop button reads “Install adapter”. Minimum compatibility
checks remain in place; incompatible installations require a user-managed upgrade.

DeepSeek uses the official CLI's `dsh --profile acp` entry point (0.1.5 series or
newer), without a separate ACP demo. Run `dsh web` to configure credentials.
Without a backend model override, the ACP profile keeps its own model settings;
explicit overrides use the standard ACP interface. Gateway-managed independent
task delegation and native Session history restoration are not provided yet.

View currently available backend agents:

```bash
qwenaudio setup
```

This command only checks — it does not install, download, or verify credentials. To check only a specific backend or get machine-readable results:

```bash
qwenaudio setup --backend codex
qwenaudio setup --json
```

## Choosing a Backend

`AGENT_PROTOCOL` is an optional configuration. When left empty, the Gateway runs in frontend-only mode, and real-time voice chat remains available; requests requiring backend execution will return a clear explanation without creating a task or guessing results. You can also use `qwenaudio --backend none` on the command line to explicitly start in frontend-only mode.

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=openclaw
```

OpenCode and OpenClaw support automatic download and installation; after configuring `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and `QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL`, they can automatically connect to Bailian models. Other backends require prior installation and native configuration; qwen-audio-agent will reuse their user-level models, tools, MCPs, Skills, and authentication where the selected protocol exposes them. MiniMax Code and Muse Code keep their own model, provider, authentication, and extension configuration under their control.

To use other agents that support ACP stdio:

```dotenv
AGENT_PROTOCOL=acp
ACP_COMMAND=your-agent
ACP_ARGS=["--acp"]
```

The command, arguments, display name, and working directory can be configured via `ACP_COMMAND`, `ACP_ARGS`, `ACP_LABEL`, and `ACP_WORKSPACE` respectively. The generic ACP entry does not provide one-click install; please install it yourself.

## Permission Modes

`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_PERMISSION_MODE` can be set to:

- `native` (default): Permissions are determined and prompted by the backend agent itself; the Gateway only forwards requests as-is.
- `full`: Grants the highest permissions at startup, allowing the backend to directly execute commands, read and write files without per-action confirmation.

`full` currently supports OpenCode, Qoder, Qwen Code, MiniMax Code, Kimi Code, Hermes, CodeBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, DeepSeek, and Muse Code; the Gateway will automatically approve permission requests from these backends. OpenClaw's execution authorization is constrained by exec approvals, elevated, and other configuration settings, and cannot be expressed via a single toggle — when `full` is selected, the Gateway will explicitly refuse to start. The highest permissions amplify the risk of accidental operations and should only be enabled in trusted projects.

Pi is a special case: it has no built-in sandbox or permission approval mechanism, and its adapter pi-acp does not implement ACP `session/request_permission`. Pi therefore always runs with the equivalent of `full` permissions regardless of the configured mode — there is no approval step at all, and no permission confirmation appears in the voice session. Use it only in trusted projects and trusted prompt environments.

The current community adapter does not wire ACP `mcpServers` into Pi, so Gateway
Session tools and independent third-layer delegation are unavailable for this backend.
Pi handles work in the current Session with its own tools.
