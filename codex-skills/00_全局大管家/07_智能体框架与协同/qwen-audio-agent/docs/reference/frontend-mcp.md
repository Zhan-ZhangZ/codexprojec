# Frontend MCP client

The frontend MCP client is the standards-based extension boundary for adding
chatbot tools without coupling them to a realtime provider or a backend Agent.
It is separate from the dedicated Web Search provider: Web Search keeps its
small built-in fallback, while general MCP servers are configured by the user.

Enable only the tools you need and describe their data sources and scope clearly. To replace web
search, prefer a [Web Search Provider](../guides/web-search.md) instead of exposing the same search
capability twice to the model.

The Gateway discovers the explicitly enabled tools at startup, gives them
stable names, and adds them to each Realtime session through the shared
frontend tool registry and executor.

## 1. Configure Remote Tools

Set `QWEN_AUDIO_FRONTEND_MCP_CONFIG` to a versioned JSON file:

```dotenv
QWEN_AUDIO_FRONTEND_MCP_CONFIG=/absolute/path/to/frontend-mcp.json
DOCUMENT_MCP_AUTHORIZATION=Bearer replace-me
```

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "servers": {
    "documents": {
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": {
        "type": "streamable-http",
        "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
        "headers": {
          "authorization": "${DOCUMENT_MCP_AUTHORIZATION}"
        }
      },
      "connectTimeoutMs": 8000,
      "tools": {
        "search": {
          "enabled": true,
          "timeoutMs": 10000,
          "maxResultBytes": 32768,
          "maxCallsPerTurn": 2,
          "description": "Search the user's configured document source."
        },
        "create_issue": {
          "enabled": true,
          "description": "Create an issue in the configured tracker."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Or Use Local stdio Tools

Install the MCP server's required runtime first. This example starts a filesystem server with `npx` and exposes only directory listing. Replace `/absolute/path/to/documents` with an actual allowed directory:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "servers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/absolute/path/to/documents"]
      },
      "tools": {
        "list_directory": { "enabled": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For compatibility, top-level `url` and `headers` fields still select Streamable
HTTP. Top-level `command`, `args`, `env`, and `cwd` fields are also accepted as
stdio shorthand. New configurations should use the explicit `transport` object.

Each exposed tool receives a stable model-visible name:
`mcp__<server>__<tool>`. Tools omitted from `tools`, or without
`enabled: true`, are never exposed.

## 3. Apply and Verify

Save one of these JSON configurations at the configured path, supply real server/tool names and credentials, then [restart the Gateway](../operations/gateway.md#applying-configuration-changes). Test a simple call before enabling more tools. Use `qwenaudio doctor` and Gateway logs for connection failures.

A configuration file alone is not enough: the service must be reachable, and the names in `tools` must match its actual tools. The remote domain above is a placeholder.

## Support and Security

- Streamable HTTP and stdio transports are supported. The legacy standalone SSE
  transport is not supported.
- Discovery and connection have a bounded timeout (8 seconds by default).
- Each frontend MCP tool execution times out after 10 seconds by default; set the tool's `timeoutMs` to override it.
- Remote servers require HTTPS. Loopback HTTP is allowed only without headers.
- A server URL may be one exact environment reference such as `${MCP_URL}`.
- Header values may reference one exact environment variable with
  `${VARIABLE}`. A missing variable is a configuration error.
- The Gateway starts stdio servers directly without a shell and closes their child
  processes when it shuts down. `command`, arguments, environment values, and
  `cwd` may use exact environment references; a configured `cwd` must be absolute.
  The child receives only the SDK's safe base environment plus explicit `env` values.
- stdio servers and backend Agents use the Gateway's shared user command search
  path. After installing a command, run `qwenaudio gateway restart`; the CLI
  refreshes the login-environment `PATH` cache used by the background service.
- `tools` is an explicit allowlist. Enabled tools execute inline in the current
  conversation turn; the Gateway does not insert a generic confirmation turn
  based on whether a tool reads or writes.
- Calls in one model response can execute concurrently. After all results are
  returned and that response ends, the Gateway requests one result summary.
  Later responses may call tools again, within the existing turn limits and deduplication rules.
- Behavioral metadata such as `readOnlyHint` and `destructiveHint` belongs to
  the MCP server's standard Tool Annotations. It is metadata, not Gateway policy.
- MCP servers must enforce any required confirmation, authorization, or business
  safety checks inside their own capability boundary.
- Schemas, descriptions, calls, time, and results are bounded. MCP results are
  treated as untrusted data and cannot override system or user instructions.
- If an enabled tool is absent or invalid during discovery, that server fails
  closed and exposes no partial tool set.

Restart the Gateway after changing this file. Put variables required by the
background service in the user `config.env`; do not commit secrets to JSON or
rely on temporary exports that exist only in the current terminal.
