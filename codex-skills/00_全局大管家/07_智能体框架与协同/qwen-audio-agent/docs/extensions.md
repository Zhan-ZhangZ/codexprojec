# Extending qwen-audio-agent

This section is for developers integrating clients, voice services, Backend Agents, or knowledge systems through existing extension interfaces.
To configure built-in capabilities, start with [Configuration](configuration.md) and [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md).

The core logical components are the Frontend Agent, Orchestration Runtime, and Backend Agent. The Gateway exposes runtime capabilities as a service; clients own I/O and environment interaction. Extend the relevant model provider, tool, BackendPort, or client protocol without moving business logic into transport. See the [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md).

## Frontend Tools: MCP, OpenAPI, Profiles

Add chatbot tools without touching the voice path: connect MCP servers through
the frontend MCP client, expose selected REST operations from an OpenAPI 3.x
document, or bundle persona plus tool configuration as a versioned Frontend
Profile.

[Frontend Profiles](reference/frontend-profile.md)

## Voice Frontend: Custom Realtime Provider

Swap the realtime speech model for another cloud service or your own stack by
implementing the provider contract and registering it in the provider
registry.

→ [Custom Provider](voice-frontends/custom-provider.md)

## Knowledge: Retrieval Provider

The runtime connects knowledge modules through a small Provider interface.
Use the built-in basic library, or connect the knowledge system you already operate.

→ [Knowledge Retrieval Provider](reference/knowledge.md)

The [LightRAG integration example](scenarios/lightrag.md) shows how to connect a complete,
independently deployed knowledge system while leaving its models, indexes, and data under
LightRAG's control.

## Backend: Connect a New Agent

Four paths put a backend behind the protocol-neutral `BackendPort`: the
zero-code generic ACP entry, a remote A2A agent, a custom adapter via the
Backend Adapter SDK, or a first-class backend with one-click install.

## Persona and Memory

The default assistant name, personality, and expression style live in `ASSISTANT.md`; output voice is configured separately.
The default Markdown provider stores user preferences and durable facts in `USER.md` /
`MEMORY.md`; configure the optional VoiceMem connector, or replace the
provider with another memory engine, without changing the voice runtime.

→ [Assistant Profile and User Preferences](reference/personalization.md) ·
[Memory Provider](reference/memory-provider.md)

VoiceMem installation and configuration example:
[`examples/voicemem`](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/tree/main/examples/voicemem).

## Client: Build Your Own

The Gateway speaks typed events over a single WebSocket. Build a custom client
against the client protocol, or embed the assistant into a host page through
the stability contract — the same channel the desktop orb, TUI, and WebUI use.

The [AI Passport example](scenarios/ai-passport.md) connects Qwen
Voice Bean to the Gateway through a LAN relay. It currently supports half-duplex
only; firmware and audio drivers are maintained in the external project.

## Desktop Appearance

The desktop orb renders replaceable pet skins: a `pet.json` manifest plus a
spritesheet.
