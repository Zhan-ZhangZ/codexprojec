### Q: How is this different from just using voice dictation with Claude Code?

Dictation replaces typing; this replaces the whole interaction loop.
The runtime keeps the conversation alive while the agent works: it
answers simple questions instantly, delegates real work to the backend
agent over ACP, and reports results back into the same conversation.
Barge-in is handled at the protocol level, not as a hotkey.

### Q: Does it require cloud services?

By default it uses DashScope realtime voice (a Qwen API key). There is
also a speech-to-speech frontend mode where VAD/STT/LLM/TTS can all be
self-hosted. Wake-word detection is always local (sherpa-onnx).

### Q: Which agents work best?

Native ACP backends (OpenCode, OpenClaw, Qoder, Kimi Code) are
one-click setups. Claude Code and Codex connect through ACP adapters;
both are supported by the one-command installer. It also runs with no
backend at all — frontend-only mode is a first-class configuration.
