# Knowledge Library

The library lets the assistant find evidence in your documents. The built-in implementation uses
lightweight local keyword retrieval and requires no separate vector database or Embedding model.
For richer semantic and graph retrieval, see the [LightRAG example](../scenarios/lightrag.md).

## 1. Enable the Library

Set this in the `config.env` used by the Gateway:

```dotenv
QWEN_AUDIO_DOMAIN_LIBRARY=on
```

[Restart for your run mode](../operations/gateway.md#applying-configuration-changes).
If you explicitly disabled `QWEN_AUDIO_KNOWLEDGE_TOOL_ENABLED`, restore it to `true`;
otherwise document management can work while the frontend has no retrieval tool.
The voice Provider must support tool calls.

## 2. Import Documents

1. Open **WebUI** connected to that Gateway and click “Knowledge Library” at the top.
2. Paste an **absolute file path on the Gateway host**, such as `/Users/me/Documents/handbook.md`.
3. Click “Add to library” and wait for import completion. Ask questions once the document appears in the list.

The built-in library accepts quoted paths copied from file managers and `file://` URLs.
Both refer to files on the Gateway host. Invalid file URLs are rejected, not treated as ordinary paths.

This is not a file uploader. A path on a remote phone does not refer to a file on the computer;
place the document on the Gateway host first. The Desktop orb and conversation panel do not
currently expose a library-management button.

| File type | Built-in handling |
| --- | --- |
| Markdown, TXT, and similar text | Imported directly; no Backend Agent required. |
| PDF, Word, PPT, and other complex documents | Converted to Markdown by a configured backend supporting isolated execution; conversion depends on its tools. |

Complex documents use an isolated execution session, not the everyday coordinator conversation,
and do not inherit voice-chat context. Import errors appear in the panel. If no converter is available,
convert the document to Markdown or TXT yourself before importing it.

The built-in library holds up to 40 documents by default. At capacity, it asks you to remove
unneeded documents instead of silently dropping older entries; existing text documents can still
be updated. Imports and conversion targets avoid existing filenames on disk, including retained
copies no longer shown in the list, so new documents do not overwrite them.

## 3. Query and Remove

Ask, for example: “Search the library: what does the handbook say about the release process?”
Built-in retrieval returns source excerpts matched by headings and body keywords; the frontend
composes the answer. It is not a full semantic retrieval system. Try the document's own terms or
a more precise question if results are weak.

“Remove” deletes the library copy and its searchable content, not the original source file.
Chat attachments are not automatically imported. Source-file changes are not automatically
synchronized either; reimport updated content.

## Data and Other Knowledge Systems

Built-in library data is stored on the Gateway host. With a cloud voice model, retrieved excerpts
are sent to that model as answer context. Complex-document conversion also uses the backend's
configured models and tools. Check that these services are appropriate for the documents.
