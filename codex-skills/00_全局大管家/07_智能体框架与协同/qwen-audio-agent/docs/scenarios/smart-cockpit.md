# Smart Cockpit

Smart Cockpit is a runnable qwen-audio-agent scenario example. Users can
naturally control the vehicle, plan routes, play music, check the weather,
place flash-buy orders, and run custom workflows while the cockpit UI reflects
vehicle and task state.

## Demo

Use natural voice for vehicle control and navigation, with cockpit UI updates.
Long-running background work can continue alongside foreground conversation.

## Core features

- Continuous conversation, natural interruption, multi-turn context, and
  runtime voice and persona switching.
- MCP-based vehicle control, navigation, music, weather, flash-buy, and custom
  workflow tools.
- A foreground Realtime fast path for low-latency operations and a backend
  Agent for flash-buy and multi-source news research. Custom-skill creation,
  loading, and foreground workflow steps stay in the foreground.
- A replaceable backend Agent connected through A2A 1.0, with ACP and custom
  adapters available as alternatives.
- Scenario-owned HTTP/SSE channels for vehicle, route, music, and order state.
- Multiple foreground tool calls finish before one combined spoken response;
  foreground MCP calls have a configurable 10-second default timeout.
- Screen route preferences silently update conversation context. UI climate
  `−` / `+` changes can trigger a user-saved temperature reminder once on entry
  into its range, without repeated reminders while the condition remains true.
- Memory follows the standard Markdown tools and prompt policy. Background news
  reports use real searches and source-page reads while foreground chat continues,
  returning a full text artifact and a short summary with verification limits.

## Architecture

![Smart cockpit framework architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/main/examples/smart-cockpit/docs/framework-architecture.svg)

The foreground supports both realtime conversation and direct tool calls;
long-running or backend-routed work goes to the cockpit Agent without blocking
conversation. The Service supplies shared scenario state, business rules, and
tool execution for both paths.

| Component | Example implementation | Main interfaces |
|---|---|---|
| `client/` | React cockpit UI + Browser Audio | GCP 7.0 / Gateway Client SDK |
| `gateway/` | qwen-audio-agent Gateway + foreground Realtime Agent | GCP / MCP / BackendPort |
| `agent/` | Qwen3.8-Flash backend Agent | A2A 1.0 / MCP |
| `service/` | Cockpit state, rules, tools, and external integrations | HTTP/SSE / MCP |

See
[`examples/smart-cockpit/docs/architecture.md`](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/blob/main/examples/smart-cockpit/docs/architecture.md)
for complete boundaries and data flows.

## Tool calling

The cockpit Service provides 38 MCP tools across six scenario domains:

| Domain | Count | Main capabilities |
|---|---:|---|
| `vehicle` | 11 | Location and state, climate, windows, lights, charging, and other controls. |
| `navigation` | 12 | Place search, routing, waypoints, favorites, and route preferences. |
| `music` | 10 | Search, playback, previous/next track, volume, media source, and favorites. |
| `weather` | 1 | City weather lookup. |
| `flashbuy` | 1 | Flash-buy product search and ordering demonstration. |
| `custom-skills` | 3 | List, create/update, and load workflows or temperature-reminder rules. |

By default, vehicle, navigation, music, weather, and custom skills expose 37
Service tools to the foreground; flash-buy exposes 1 Service tool to the backend.
The Realtime base total is **44**: 7 Gateway built-ins + 37 foreground MCP tools,
before capability-gated tools such as frontend search are added.
Scenario developers can change this routing in `service/tools/surface-routing.json`.

The backend also uses 2 framework retrieval tools, `web_search` and `fetch_url`,
through the public `qwen-audio-agent/web-retrieval` factory. They are not counted
in the 38 scenario tools and preserve the existing provider configuration and
safe webpage-reading protections. See [web search](../guides/web-search.md);
the default keyless search is an experimental fallback, not a live-news guarantee.

## Run the example

```bash
cp examples/smart-cockpit/.env.example examples/smart-cockpit/.env.local
# Set DASHSCOPE_API_KEY in .env.local; map keys are optional.
npm run example:smart-cockpit:install
npm run example:smart-cockpit
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The command starts service, agent, gateway, and
client together.

## Benchmark

The accuracy suites cover vehicle, navigation, music and weather, not flash-buy,
custom skills or long-running background tasks.

- **Short cases:** 86 cases and 111 user turns; expected calls cover 34 tools.
  Results use full-case pass rate.
- **Long dialogue:** 10 separately designed 50-turn conversations, covering
  22 of those tools. The results page reports per-turn behavior across 250
  tool-required and 250 no-tool turns.
- **Paths:** Text, controlled Realtime, and full Harness. Harness uses production
  frontend composition, with different prompts, tool outputs and runtime guards.
- **Tool-placement latency:** direct frontend calls versus backend delegation,
  with Realtime in both paths. Test turns requiring tools are not steps to
  finish one task or the number of valid timing samples.

## Replace and extend

| Goal | Change |
|---|---|
| Replace the cockpit UI or audio I/O | `client/` |
| Replace the backend Agent | Change `COCKPIT_AGENT_CARD_URL` or replace `agent/` |
| Add scenario tools, state, or external services | `service/` and `service/tools/` |
| Change foreground personas or backend-task semantics | `gateway/` |
