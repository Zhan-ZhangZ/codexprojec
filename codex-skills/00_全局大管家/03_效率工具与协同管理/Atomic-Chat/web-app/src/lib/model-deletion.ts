/**
 * Delete a model and reconcile the app state around it.
 *
 * Only local providers (llama.cpp, MLX, …) own weights on disk and register an
 * inference engine, so only they go through `stopModel` + `deleteModel`. A
 * cloud or self-hosted provider (OpenRouter, a custom OpenAI-compatible
 * endpoint) has no engine — asking for one used to reject with "No engine
 * registered for provider" (#264) — and removing its model is purely a
 * store-level tombstone.
 *
 * Rejects when a local engine refuses (unknown model, missing `model.yml`, a
 * managed model the core could not stop); the caller is expected to
 * surface that. Resolves with what the engine freed when it measured it.
