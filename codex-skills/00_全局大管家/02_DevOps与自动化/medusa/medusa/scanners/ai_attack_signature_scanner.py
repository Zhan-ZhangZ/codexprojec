"""
AI Attack-Signature Scanner — always-on, high-precision.

Most AI scanners (OWASPLLMScanner, PromptLeakageScanner, ...) gate themselves
behind an LLM-context confidence score: if a file has no openai/anthropic/
langchain-style indicators, get_confidence_score() returns 0 and the registry
never runs them (base.py: `if confidence > 0`). That means a jailbreak or
prompt-injection payload sitting in a plain .py/.txt/.json/dataset file is
silently missed — a false negative, which for a security scanner is the
dangerous failure mode.

This scanner closes that gap. It runs on EVERY text file (no LLM-context gate)
and matches a small, curated, high-precision signature set
(medusa/rules/attack_signatures/) — named jailbreaks and classic
instruction-override injections. Precision is the contract: every pattern here
must fire overwhelmingly on real payloads, not generic words, so always-on
matching does not reintroduce false positives.
