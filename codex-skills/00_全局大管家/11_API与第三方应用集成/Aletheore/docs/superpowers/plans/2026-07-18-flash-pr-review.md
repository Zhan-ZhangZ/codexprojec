# Automatic DeepSeek V4 Flash PR Review Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** An automatic, Pro-tier-only code review that fires on every PR push, reads the real diff via GitHub's compare API (no cloning), and posts citation-constrained findings (exact file+line, concrete checkable issue only — no style opinions) as their own PR comment, using DeepSeek V4 Flash.

**Architecture:** A new job (`run_flash_review_job`) enqueued alongside the existing `run_pr_scan_job` from the same `pull_request` webhook. Reviews only the diff since the last-reviewed commit for that PR (not the whole PR every push), debounced by 2 minutes per PR to absorb rapid force-push spam, and gated by the shared per-installation spend cap from the companion plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-shared-llm-spend-cap.md`) — **that plan must be implemented first**, since every task below imports functions it creates (`get_llm_spend_this_month`, `record_llm_spend`, `get_extra_seats` from `scan_worker/db.py`; `monthly_cap_for_installation`, `cost_for_usage` from `app_server/llm_cost.py`; the `on_usage` hook on `OpenAICompatibleAdapter`).

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12, httpx, psycopg, pytest. No new dependencies.

## Global Constraints

- Pro-tier only — free-tier installations get no Flash review at all, silently (matches the existing `_maybe_send_slack_alert`/`_maybe_create_check_run` pattern in `scan_worker/jobs.py`).
- Findings must be citation-constrained: exact `file` + exact `line` from the diff, plus a concrete, checkable `issue` description — never a style opinion, never "consider refactoring." Enforced by parsing the model's structured JSON output, not just prompting for it — anything that doesn't parse to the expected shape is treated as zero findings, never posted as malformed prose.
- Debounce: 2 minutes per PR, checked and reserved atomically before any GitHub or LLM call.
- Spend: shared with managed audits via the cap from the companion plan — this feature does not have its own separate budget.
- All file paths below are relative to `github-app/` unless prefixed with `prototype/`.

### Task 1: Migration — `flash_review_state` table

**Files:**
- Create: `migrations/006_flash_review_state.sql`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: table `flash_review_state(installation_id, repo_full_name, pr_number, last_reviewed_sha, last_attempted_at)` — consumed by Task 4.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the migration**

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS flash_review_state (
    installation_id    BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES installations(installation_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    repo_full_name      TEXT NOT NULL,
    pr_number           INT NOT NULL,
    last_reviewed_sha   TEXT,
    last_attempted_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (installation_id, repo_full_name, pr_number)
);
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Apply it to the local test Postgres and update the test glob**

Run: `PGPASSWORD=test psql -h localhost -p 55433 -U postgres -d aletheore_test -f migrations/006_flash_review_state.sql`
Expected: `CREATE TABLE`.

In `tests/conftest.py`, update the migration glob from `00[2345]_*.sql` (set by the companion spend-cap plan) to `00[23456]_*.sql`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add migrations/006_flash_review_state.sql tests/conftest.py
git commit -m "feat: add flash_review_state table"
```

### Task 2: Fetch a real PR diff via GitHub's compare API

**Files:**
- Modify: `scan_worker/github_api.py`
- Test: `tests/test_github_api.py` (create if it doesn't already exist — check first: `ls tests/test_github_api.py`; if absent, create it following the httpx `MockTransport` pattern already used throughout this test suite, e.g. in `tests/test_managed_audit_api.py`)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `fetch_pr_diff(client: httpx.Client, token: str, repo_full_name: str, base_ref: str, head_ref: str) -> str` — consumed by Task 5.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```python
import httpx

from scan_worker.github_api import fetch_pr_diff


def test_fetch_pr_diff_concatenates_real_patches():
    def handler(request: httpx.Request) -> httpx.Response:
        assert request.url.path == "/repos/octocat/hello-world/compare/aaa...bbb"
        return httpx.Response(
            200,
            json={
                "files": [
                    {
                        "filename": "app.py",
                        "patch": "@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@\n def hello():\n+    print('hi')\n     pass",
                    },
                    {"filename": "image.png", "patch": None},
                ]
            },
        )

    client = httpx.Client(transport=httpx.MockTransport(handler), base_url="https://api.github.com")
    diff_text = fetch_pr_diff(client, "fake-token", "octocat/hello-world", "aaa", "bbb")

    assert "app.py" in diff_text
    assert "print('hi')" in diff_text
    assert "image.png" not in diff_text


def test_fetch_pr_diff_returns_empty_string_when_no_files_changed():
    def handler(request: httpx.Request) -> httpx.Response:
        return httpx.Response(200, json={"files": []})

    client = httpx.Client(transport=httpx.MockTransport(handler), base_url="https://api.github.com")
    diff_text = fetch_pr_diff(client, "fake-token", "octocat/hello-world", "aaa", "bbb")

    assert diff_text == ""
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_github_api.py -v`
Expected: FAIL with `ImportError: cannot import name 'fetch_pr_diff'`

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement it**

Add to `scan_worker/github_api.py`:

```python
def fetch_pr_diff(
    client: httpx.Client, token: str, repo_full_name: str, base_ref: str, head_ref: str
) -> str:
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"token {token}",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",
    }
    response = client.get(
        f"/repos/{repo_full_name}/compare/{base_ref}...{head_ref}", headers=headers
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
    parts = []
    for file in data.get("files", []):
        patch = file.get("patch")
        if patch:
            parts.append(f"--- {file['filename']} ---\n{patch}")
    return "\n\n".join(parts)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_github_api.py -v`
Expected: All pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add scan_worker/github_api.py tests/test_github_api.py
git commit -m "feat: fetch real PR diff text via GitHub compare API"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_jobs.py -k flash_review -v`
Expected: FAIL — `run_flash_review_job` doesn't exist yet.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement it**

Update the imports at the top of `scan_worker/jobs.py`:

```python
from scan_worker.flash_review import review_diff
from scan_worker.github_api import create_check_run, fetch_pr_diff, upsert_pr_comment
from scan_worker.db import (
    check_and_reserve_flash_review_attempt,
    check_and_reserve_managed_audit,
    get_extra_seats,
    get_installation as get_installation_row,
    get_last_endpoint_health,
    get_last_reviewed_sha,
    get_latest_evidence,
    get_llm_spend_this_month,
    insert_endpoint_health,
    insert_repo_history,
    list_monitored_installations,
    list_repos_for_installation,
    record_llm_spend,
    set_last_reviewed_sha,
)
```

(This replaces the existing `from scan_worker.github_api import create_check_run, upsert_pr_comment` line with the version above that also imports `fetch_pr_diff`.)

Add near `AUDIT_COMMENT_MARKER`:

```python
FLASH_REVIEW_MARKER = "<!-- aletheore-flash-review -->"
```

Add the new job function:

```python
def run_flash_review_job(
    installation_id: int,
    repo_full_name: str,
    pr_number: int,
    base_sha: str,
    head_sha: str,
) -> None:
    settings = get_settings()
    installation = get_installation_row(settings.database_url, installation_id)
    if installation is None or installation["plan"] == "free":
        return

    if not check_and_reserve_flash_review_attempt(
        settings.database_url, installation_id, repo_full_name, pr_number
    ):
        return

    extra_seats = get_extra_seats(settings.database_url, installation_id)
    monthly_cap = monthly_cap_for_installation(7.00, extra_seats)
    current_spend = get_llm_spend_this_month(settings.database_url, installation_id)
    if current_spend >= monthly_cap:
        return

    app_jwt = generate_app_jwt(settings.github_app_id, settings.github_app_private_key)
    token = _token_sync(installation_id, app_jwt)
    client = httpx.Client(base_url="https://api.github.com")

    last_reviewed_sha = get_last_reviewed_sha(
        settings.database_url, installation_id, repo_full_name, pr_number
    )
    diff_base = last_reviewed_sha or base_sha
    diff_text = fetch_pr_diff(client, token, repo_full_name, diff_base, head_sha)

    spend_accumulator = {"total": 0.0}

    def _on_usage(prompt_tokens: int, completion_tokens: int) -> None:
        spend_accumulator["total"] += cost_for_usage(
            "deepseek-v4-flash", prompt_tokens, completion_tokens
        )

    findings = review_diff(diff_text, on_usage=_on_usage)
    record_llm_spend(settings.database_url, installation_id, spend_accumulator["total"])

    if findings:
        lines = [f"{FLASH_REVIEW_MARKER}\n### Aletheore Flash review\n"]
        for finding in findings:
            lines.append(f"- `{finding['file']}:{finding['line']}` — {finding['issue']}")
        body = "\n".join(lines)
    else:
        body = f"{FLASH_REVIEW_MARKER}\n### Aletheore Flash review\n\nNo issues found in this diff."

    upsert_pr_comment(client, token, repo_full_name, pr_number, body, marker=FLASH_REVIEW_MARKER)
    set_last_reviewed_sha(settings.database_url, installation_id, repo_full_name, pr_number, head_sha)
```

Also add `from app_server.llm_cost import cost_for_usage, monthly_cap_for_installation` to the imports if the companion spend-cap plan's Task 7 didn't already add it (it did — this line already exists in the file after that plan is implemented; do not duplicate it).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_jobs.py -v`
Expected: All pass, including every pre-existing test in this file.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add scan_worker/jobs.py tests/test_jobs.py
git commit -m "feat: add run_flash_review_job"
```

### Task 6: Wire the webhook to enqueue the new job

**Files:**
- Modify: `app_server/webhooks/pull_request.py`
- Test: `tests/test_pull_request_webhook.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `run_flash_review_job` (Task 5), enqueued by name (RQ job string, matching the existing `run_pr_scan_job` pattern).

- [ ] **Step 1: Update the existing tests — they will break otherwise**

The existing tests in `tests/test_pull_request_webhook.py` assert `fake_queue.enqueue.assert_called_once()`, which will start failing once a second job is enqueued from the same handler. Replace the whole file with:

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

import pytest

from app_server.webhooks.pull_request import handle_pull_request_event


def _payload(action: str):
    return {
        "action": action,
        "number": 42,
        "installation": {"id": 111},
        "repository": {"full_name": "octocat/hello-world"},
        "pull_request": {
            "base": {"sha": "aaa111"},
            "head": {"sha": "bbb222"},
        },
    }


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_opened_enqueues_both_jobs():
    fake_queue = MagicMock()
    await handle_pull_request_event(_payload("opened"), "redis://unused", queue=fake_queue)

    assert fake_queue.enqueue.call_count == 2
    job_names = {call.args[0] for call in fake_queue.enqueue.call_args_list}
    assert job_names == {"scan_worker.jobs.run_pr_scan_job", "scan_worker.jobs.run_flash_review_job"}
    for call in fake_queue.enqueue.call_args_list:
        _, kwargs = call
        assert kwargs["installation_id"] == 111
        assert kwargs["repo_full_name"] == "octocat/hello-world"
        assert kwargs["pr_number"] == 42
        assert kwargs["base_sha"] == "aaa111"
        assert kwargs["head_sha"] == "bbb222"


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_synchronize_enqueues_both_jobs():
    fake_queue = MagicMock()
    await handle_pull_request_event(_payload("synchronize"), "redis://unused", queue=fake_queue)
    assert fake_queue.enqueue.call_count == 2


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_reopened_enqueues_both_jobs():
    fake_queue = MagicMock()
    await handle_pull_request_event(_payload("reopened"), "redis://unused", queue=fake_queue)
    assert fake_queue.enqueue.call_count == 2


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_closed_does_not_enqueue():
    fake_queue = MagicMock()
    await handle_pull_request_event(_payload("closed"), "redis://unused", queue=fake_queue)
    fake_queue.enqueue.assert_not_called()


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_labeled_does_not_enqueue():
    fake_queue = MagicMock()
    await handle_pull_request_event(_payload("labeled"), "redis://unused", queue=fake_queue)
    fake_queue.enqueue.assert_not_called()
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_pull_request_webhook.py -v`
Expected: FAIL — `call_count == 2` assertions fail with `call_count == 1` (only the existing job is enqueued so far).

- [ ] **Step 3: Wire in the second enqueue call**

In `app_server/webhooks/pull_request.py`:

```python
ENQUEUE_ACTIONS = ("opened", "reopened", "synchronize")


async def handle_pull_request_event(payload: dict, redis_url: str, queue=None) -> None:
    if payload.get("action") not in ENQUEUE_ACTIONS:
        return

    if queue is None:
        from redis import Redis
        from rq import Queue

        queue = Queue("scans", connection=Redis.from_url(redis_url))

    queue.enqueue(
        "scan_worker.jobs.run_pr_scan_job",
        installation_id=payload["installation"]["id"],
        repo_full_name=payload["repository"]["full_name"],
        pr_number=payload["number"],
        base_sha=payload["pull_request"]["base"]["sha"],
        head_sha=payload["pull_request"]["head"]["sha"],
    )
    queue.enqueue(
        "scan_worker.jobs.run_flash_review_job",
        installation_id=payload["installation"]["id"],
        repo_full_name=payload["repository"]["full_name"],
        pr_number=payload["number"],
        base_sha=payload["pull_request"]["base"]["sha"],
        head_sha=payload["pull_request"]["head"]["sha"],
    )
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_pull_request_webhook.py -v`
Expected: All pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add app_server/webhooks/pull_request.py tests/test_pull_request_webhook.py
git commit -m "feat: enqueue run_flash_review_job alongside run_pr_scan_job"
```

---

### Task 7: Real end-to-end verification

**Files:** none modified — verification only.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the full test suite**

Run: `cd github-app && TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:test@localhost:55433/aletheore_test" python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`
Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 2: Build a real tiny PR-like diff and run a real Flash review against it**

```bash
cd /tmp
rm -rf flash-review-test && mkdir flash-review-test && cd flash-review-test
git init -q
git config user.email "test@example.com"
git config user.name "Test"
cat > app.py <<'EOF'
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
EOF
git add . && git commit -q -m "base"
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
cat > app.py <<'EOF'
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b  # no check for b == 0
EOF
git add . && git commit -q -m "head"
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
git diff "$BASE_SHA" "$HEAD_SHA" > /tmp/flash-review-test/real.diff
cat /tmp/flash-review-test/real.diff
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Call `review_diff` directly against this real diff, with the real DeepSeek key**

```bash
cd /Users/arihantkaul/Documents/GitHub/Veridion/github-app
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=$(ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 $PROD_SSH "cd /root/aletheore/github-app && docker compose exec -T scan-worker printenv DEEPSEEK_API_KEY")
python3 -c "
from scan_worker.flash_review import review_diff
diff_text = open('/tmp/flash-review-test/real.diff').read()
usage_totals = {'prompt': 0, 'completion': 0}
def on_usage(p, c):
    usage_totals['prompt'] += p
    usage_totals['completion'] += c
findings = review_diff(diff_text, on_usage=on_usage)
print('Findings:', findings)
print('Usage:', usage_totals)
"
```

Expected: `findings` is a non-empty list containing at least one entry citing `app.py` and a line number, with an `issue` describing the real, actual problem (dividing by `b` with no zero-check) — a genuine, correct, citation-constrained finding on a real, deliberately-flawed diff. `usage_totals` shows nonzero real token counts.

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the citation constraint held — no vague/style findings**

Manually read the `findings` output from Step 3. Confirm every entry names a real file and a real line number present in `real.diff`, and that the `issue` text describes a concrete, checkable problem (not "this could be cleaner" or similar vague language). If a vague finding appears, the prompt in `scan_worker/flash_review.py`'s `FLASH_REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT` needs strengthening before this ships — return to Task 3 and tighten the wording, then re-run this verification task from Step 1.

- [ ] **Step 5: No commit needed — this task is verification-only**

If Steps 1-4 all pass, the feature is confirmed working end-to-end with a real DeepSeek Flash call producing a real, correct, citation-constrained finding.
