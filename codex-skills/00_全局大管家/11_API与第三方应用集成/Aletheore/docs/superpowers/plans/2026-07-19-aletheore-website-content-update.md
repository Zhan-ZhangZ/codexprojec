# Aletheore Marketing Website Content Update Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. This is a content/copy update, not TDD software work - there are no unit tests to write; each task's "verify" step is a manual read-through instead.

**Goal:** Bring `website/` (the static marketing site, served from `aletheore.com` via Vercel) up to date with everything real that has shipped, and fix stale post-rename references left over from the `evidence.json` → `air.json` rename. Nothing in this plan is aspirational copy - every claim below is grounded in code verified during this session (see the "Evidence" note on each task).

**Architecture:** Plain static HTML/CSS/JS (no build step, no framework). All edits are direct edits to `website/index.html`, `website/pricing.html`, and `website/showcase-data.js`. No new pages needed.

## Global Constraints

- Do not invent features. Every bullet/claim added must trace to something verified in this session (cited per-task below). If in doubt, leave it out rather than guess.
- Match the existing site's voice: plain, concrete, first-person-founder tone (see the existing hero copy) - not generic SaaS marketing language.
- The GitHub Marketplace listing is **submitted and under review, not yet approved/live** as of 2026-07-19. Any copy referencing it must say "submitted for review" / "coming soon to GitHub Marketplace" - never imply it's already installable from Marketplace, since that would be false until GitHub approves it.

### Task 1: Fix stale post-rename `evidence.json`/`evidence.toon` references

**Files:**
- Modify: `website/index.html`
- Modify: `website/showcase-data.js`

**Evidence:** This repo's runtime was renamed from `.aletheore/evidence.json`/`.aletheore/evidence.toon` to `.aletheore/air.json`/`.aletheore/air.toon` earlier this session (the "AIR" rename, verified end-to-end via a live audit run). The website was never updated and still shows the old filenames in six places - this is factually wrong today: if a user runs `aletheore scan` and looks for `.aletheore/evidence.json` as the homepage's own example output tells them to, the file won't exist.

- [ ] **Step 1: Fix `website/index.html` line 42**

Change:
```
writes what it found to <code>evidence.json</code>
```
to:
```
writes what it found to <code>air.json</code>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Fix `website/index.html` line 47**

Change:
```
<code>aletheore scan</code> runs once and writes two files: <code>evidence.json</code> (the canonical record - languages, dependency graph, clusters, git activity, secrets, licenses, vulnerabilities, API endpoints) and <code>evidence.toon</code>, a <a href="https://toonformat.dev">TOON</a>-encoded copy of the same data
```
to:
```
<code>aletheore scan</code> runs once and writes two files: <code>air.json</code> (the canonical record - languages, dependency graph, clusters, git activity, secrets, licenses, vulnerabilities, API endpoints) and <code>air.toon</code>, a <a href="https://toonformat.dev">TOON</a>-encoded copy of the same data
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Fix `website/index.html` line 52**

Change:
```
Every capability below runs from the same <code>evidence.json</code>
```
to:
```
Every capability below runs from the same <code>air.json</code>
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Fix `website/index.html` line 116**

Change:
```
Measured against Aletheore's own <code>evidence.json</code>/<code>evidence.toon</code> pair from a real self-scan
```
to:
```
Measured against Aletheore's own <code>air.json</code>/<code>air.toon</code> pair from a real self-scan
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Fix `website/index.html` line 147** (the terminal demo output block)

Change:
```
Evidence written to .aletheore/evidence.json<br>
```
to:
```
Evidence written to .aletheore/air.json<br>
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Fix `website/showcase-data.js` line 49**

Change:
```js
"source": "Aletheore's own evidence.json/evidence.toon (self-scan, 2026-07-18)",
```
to:
```js
"source": "Aletheore's own air.json/air.toon (self-scan, 2026-07-18)",
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify no stale references remain**

Run: `grep -rn "evidence\.json\|evidence\.toon" website/*.html website/*.js`
Expected: no output (zero matches).

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add website/index.html website/showcase-data.js
git commit -m "fix: website still referenced pre-rename evidence.json/evidence.toon filenames"
```

### Task 1B: Introduce "AIR" as a named concept, not just a filename swap

**Files:**
- Modify: `website/index.html`

**Why this task exists:** Task 1 above just swaps the old filename for the new one everywhere it appears. That undersells the point of the rename - "AIR" (Aletheore Intermediate Representation) was chosen specifically because it's a real, useful piece of branding: a named, portable concept ("the AIR") that's easier to talk about than "the evidence file," and ties the product name into its own core artifact. Do Task 1's filename swap first, then layer this on top - don't skip straight to this task, since it depends on the corrected `air.json`/`air.toon` references already being in place.

**Evidence:** `air.json`/`air.toon` are real, shipped filenames (`prototype/aletheore/evidence.py`'s writer, verified end-to-end via a live audit run this session). "AIR" as the spelled-out name for this concept was the whole reason for the rename - it should be introduced deliberately, once, with its own brief definition, not left implicit.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add a short, explicit definition right after the first mention**

In `website/index.html`, in the `id="why"` section (right after the sentence fixed in Task 1 Step 1, "writes what it found to `air.json`"), add one new sentence introducing the name:

Change the end of that paragraph (after Task 1's fix) from:
```
writes what it found to <code>air.json</code>, and every other command...
```
to:
```
writes what it found to <code>air.json</code> - the AIR, Aletheore's Intermediate Representation - and every other command...
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Reinforce it once more in the "How it actually works" section**

In the `id="how"` section (the paragraph fixed in Task 1 Step 2), after the sentence describing `air.json`/`air.toon`, add a short closing sentence:
```
Everything downstream - <code>query</code>, <code>diff</code>, the dashboard, the MCP server, the GitHub App - reads the same AIR. One evidence format, one source of truth, one name for it.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify restraint**

Read both edits back - "AIR" should be introduced clearly exactly once (Step 1) and reinforced once (Step 2), not sprinkled into every paragraph as a buzzword. Don't rename `<code>air.json</code>`/`<code>air.toon</code>` code-literal mentions elsewhere on the page to "AIR" - those stay as the literal filenames since that's what a user actually sees in their terminal; "AIR" is the spoken/marketing name for the concept, the code literals stay literal.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add website/index.html
git commit -m "feat: introduce AIR (Aletheore Intermediate Representation) as a named concept"
```

---

### Task 2: Fix stale "8 languages" claim to the real count of 11

**Files:**
- Modify: `website/index.html`

**Evidence:** Verified this session by reading `prototype/pyproject.toml` and `prototype/aletheore/scanner/graph.py`'s `EXTENSION` map directly: the scanner has real tree-sitter parsing wired in for **11** languages - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, C#. The site currently undersells this by three languages.

- [ ] **Step 1: Fix `website/index.html` line 57**

Change:
```
Secrets, dependency vulnerabilities and licenses across 8 languages, API endpoint mapping, architecture clustering, and full git history
```
to:
```
Secrets, dependency vulnerabilities and licenses across 11 languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, C#), API endpoint mapping, architecture clustering, and full git history
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add website/index.html
git commit -m "fix: update stale '8 languages' claim to the real count of 11"
```

---

### Task 3: Add missing deterministic-feature cards to the homepage feature grid

**Files:**
- Modify: `website/index.html`

**Evidence:** These are real, shipped, tested scanner capabilities that exist in `prototype/aletheore/` but have zero representation anywhere on the site today - confirmed by grep against the current homepage content (no mention of "dead code", "hotspot", "database", or the newly-shipped infrastructure/environment-variable detection).
- Dead code detection: `prototype/aletheore/dead_code.py`.
- Git hotspots / history intelligence: part of `git_intel` evidence, surfaced via `aletheore query hotspots` and the dashboard.
- Database model detection: `prototype/aletheore/scanner/detect.py`'s `detect_database()` (ORM frameworks, migration directories, schema files) - shipped this session, independently verified live against this repo (found 4 real migration files).
- Infrastructure/environment detection: `detect_infrastructure()`/`detect_environment_variables()` in the same file - shipped this session, independently verified live (found the real `github-app/docker-compose.yml` with 6 services, 11 real env var names with zero values captured).

**Context:** The feature grid is a repeating `<article class="feature-card">` pattern - see `website/index.html` lines 55-80 for the existing five cards. Add these three new cards in the same `<div class="feature-grid">` block, using the exact same markup shape (a `$ aletheore ...` command line, an `<h3>` title, one descriptive `<p>`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add three new feature cards**

Insert these three `<article class="feature-card">` blocks into the `<div class="feature-grid">` in `website/index.html` (after the existing "Deterministic scan" card is a natural place, but exact position doesn't matter - keep them together):

```html
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">$ aletheore query dead-code</p>
          <h3>Dead code detection</h3>
          <p>Flags unreachable modules and functions from real call-graph analysis - not a guess, a traced absence of any incoming edge from a known entry point.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">$ aletheore query hotspots</p>
          <h3>Git hotspot intelligence</h3>
          <p>Surfaces the files that change most and who actually owns them, straight from git log - the parts of your codebase most likely to need a careful review.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">$ aletheore query database</p>
          <h3>Database &amp; infrastructure detection</h3>
          <p>Finds ORM frameworks, migration directories, schema files, Docker Compose services, Kubernetes manifests, and declared environment variable names (never values) - all from static analysis, nothing executed.</p>
        </article>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify**

Open `website/index.html` in a browser (or `file://` path) and confirm the new cards render in the feature grid with the same visual styling as the existing five (no unclosed tags, no missing class).

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add website/index.html
git commit -m "feat: add dead code, git hotspot, and database/infra detection cards to homepage"
```

---

### Task 4: Add a "Hosted GitHub App" section introducing the paid product

**Files:**
- Modify: `website/index.html`

**Evidence:** The homepage currently only mentions a "GitHub Action" card (the older composite Action for PR diffs) and has zero mention of the separate, newer GitHub App product (webhooks, managed audits, Flash review, Slack/Teams alerts, check runs, health monitoring) - confirmed via grep, zero hits for "GitHub App" or "Marketplace" anywhere on the homepage. This is the single biggest content gap: a visitor reading the homepage today has no way to discover the hosted product exists at all.

**Context on wording:** As of 2026-07-19 the GitHub Marketplace listing ("Aletheore for GitHub") has been submitted and is under GitHub's review - it is not yet publicly installable from Marketplace. Do not link a `github.com/marketplace/...` URL yet if it 404s; use a "Coming soon to GitHub Marketplace" framing and link to the pricing page instead, where the Free/Pro plans are already described.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add a new section**

Insert a new `<section>` in `website/index.html`, right after the closing `</section>` of the `id="features"` block and before `<section id="proof-zone"` (i.e., between the deterministic-scanner feature grid and the proof-zone showcase section):

```html
    <section id="github-app">
      <h2>Also available as a hosted GitHub App.</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Everything above runs locally with the CLI. If you'd rather it just run on every pull request without you doing anything, the Aletheore GitHub App posts the same evidence-grounded findings as PR comments and branch-protection check runs automatically - free on every plan.</p>
      <div class="feature-grid">
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">on: pull_request</p>
          <h3>Automatic PR comments</h3>
          <p>Every pull request gets a comment listing new secrets, vulnerabilities, and license issues - free, no setup beyond installing the App.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">on: pull_request</p>
          <h3>Branch-protection check runs</h3>
          <p>A check run fails the pull request when a new secret is detected, so it can gate merges the same way any other required check does.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">/aletheore audit</p>
          <h3>AI-powered managed audits (Pro)</h3>
          <p>Comment <code>/aletheore audit</code> on any pull request for a full narrative audit report - security, architecture, and investor-style perspectives, grounded in the same deterministic evidence, no API key required.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">on: pull_request</p>
          <h3>Automatic Flash reviews (Pro)</h3>
          <p>Every push to an open pull request gets a fast, citation-constrained review of just the new diff - every finding names an exact file and line, or it isn't reported at all.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">Slack / Teams</p>
          <h3>Alerts on new findings (Pro)</h3>
          <p>Point Aletheore at a Slack or Microsoft Teams webhook and get notified the moment a new secret or vulnerability lands on a pull request.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="feature-card">
          <p class="feature-cmd">GET /v1/health/...</p>
          <h3>Endpoint health monitoring (Pro)</h3>
          <p>Aletheore maps your API endpoints from source, then checks them live on a schedule and alerts on reachability or latency regressions.</p>
        </article>
      </div>
      <p class="section-intro">
        <a href="https://github.com/marketplace" rel="noopener">Coming soon to GitHub Marketplace</a> - the listing is submitted and under review. In the meantime, see the <a href="pricing.html">Free and Pro plans</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify**

Read through the new section for accuracy against this task's Evidence note - confirm no claim here goes beyond what's listed (e.g. don't add "SOC 2 compliant" or similar unverified claims).

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add website/index.html
git commit -m "feat: add homepage section introducing the hosted GitHub App"
```

---

### Task 5: Add Flash review to the pricing page's Pro plan feature list

**Files:**
- Modify: `website/pricing.html`

**Evidence:** `website/pricing.html`'s Pro plan already lists "Managed audit runs from PR comments, CLI, or MCP", "Slack / Teams alerts on new findings", "Branch-protection Check Runs for new secrets", and "Endpoint health monitoring and a public status API" - but has zero mention of Flash review, a real, shipped, tested Pro-tier feature (`github-app/scan_worker/flash_review.py`, wired into the `pull_request` webhook alongside the free diff comment).

- [ ] **Step 1: Find the Pro plan's feature list**

Open `website/pricing.html` and locate the `<h3>Pro</h3>` plan's feature list (a `<ul>` near the existing "Managed audit runs from PR comments..." line).

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the missing bullet**

Add a new `<li>` to that list, in the same style as its neighbors:
```html
<li>Automatic Flash reviews on every push to an open pull request</li>
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add website/pricing.html
git commit -m "feat: add Flash review to the pricing page's Pro feature list"
```

---

### Task 6: Add the GitHub Marketplace status link to the pricing page

**Files:**
- Modify: `website/pricing.html`

**Context:** Same "submitted, not yet approved" constraint as Task 4 - phrase this as pending, not live.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add a status line near the Pro plan's call-to-action**

Add, near wherever the Pro plan's existing sign-up/CTA button or link is:
```html
<p class="plan-note">Also available as a GitHub App - <a href="https://github.com/marketplace" rel="noopener">listing submitted, currently under GitHub's review</a>.</p>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add website/pricing.html
git commit -m "feat: note GitHub Marketplace listing status on pricing page"
```

---

### Task 7: Final read-through

- [ ] **Step 1: Open every changed page in a browser and read top to bottom**

Check: no broken HTML (unclosed tags), no remaining stale `evidence.json`/`evidence.toon`/`8 languages` references anywhere, the new GitHub App section reads naturally in context, no claim beyond what's cited in this plan's Evidence notes.

- [ ] **Step 2: Grep for the two known stale terms once more, repo-wide**

Run: `grep -rn "evidence\.json\|evidence\.toon\|8 languages" website/`
Expected: zero matches.

- [ ] **Step 3: Deploy**

This site deploys via Vercel on push to the branch it's connected to (confirmed this session via the Vercel bot comments appearing on PRs against this repo) - a normal `git push` to the relevant branch is sufficient, no separate deploy step needed. Confirm the live site at `aletheore.com` reflects the changes after Vercel's build completes.
