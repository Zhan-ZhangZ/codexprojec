# Deterministic scanner evaluation — closing the LLM blind spot on stateful/adversarial trust bugs

**Status update (2026-09-21)**: SonarQube, Semgrep, Bearer, gosec, Bandit, and Joern are now
real, wired-in, integration-tested code, not just a recommendation - see
`deterministic_scanner_integration_scope.md`'s "What actually shipped" section. Joern's own
query (`joern_queries/asymmetric_cache_trust_go.sc`) is the real CFG-based script this doc
described building and validating earlier the same night - rebuilt from scratch after the
original scratch-directory copy was deleted, re-validated against the same real target
(grafana/grafana#103633) and the same three other real Go repos, zero false positives. The
rest of this doc's findings (Error Prone, Infer, PMD, SpotBugs, Phasar, Graudit, Trivy,
Reviewdog, Open Code Review) are unchanged - still real research, not yet integrated.

## Context

A full night of testing (2026-09-20) established a real, repeatable gap: 8 models
(GLM-5.3-Flash, DeepSeek-V4-Flash, gpt-5.6-luna, gpt-4.1-mini, o4-mini,
NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning, google/gemma-4-26B, NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B),
across plain-prompt generation, a targeted "adversarial state change" prompt
rule, and full tool-executing agent mode with real repo access, all missed the
same two real security bugs from the validated Martian Code Review Bench gold
set:

- **grafana/grafana#103633** (High/security): `Check` trusts a cached
  permission grant immediately but re-derives a cached denial from a fresh DB
  lookup — a revoked-but-still-cached grant can outlive the revocation.
- **getsentry/sentry#67876** (Medium/security): OAuth `state` is derived from
  `pipeline.signature` (a static, predictable value) instead of a fresh
  per-request random value, defeating the replay-resistance the parameter
  exists for.

GLM-5.3-Flash (production's real generation model) was the best performer of
everything tested (2/4 hits on a small security-tagged spot-check) and stays
the production default — nothing tested beat it. Neither more context
(`referenced_symbol_context`), a rewritten safety rule targeting this exact
bug shape, nor real `grep`/`read` tool access to the full repo changed the
outcome on either bug, across any model. Full detail in this session's
transcript; no separate write-up of the model comparison exists yet beyond
this doc.

**Conclusion driving this evaluation**: this is not a model-selection problem.
It's worth checking whether a deterministic (non-LLM) layer can catch what no
LLM tested here could.

## What we actually need (not a generic SAST tool)

Both unsolved bugs share a shape neither general-purpose SAST rules nor paid
taint analysis are built for:

1. **grafana-103633**: an *asymmetric-trust invariant* — two code paths
   handling the same resource (a permission decision) apply different
   freshness/trust guarantees to opposite outcomes (grant vs. deny). This
   requires relating two non-adjacent code locations and recognizing an
   implicit domain invariant ("both outcomes should have the same staleness
   guarantee") that's never expressed syntactically anywhere in the code.
2. **sentry-67876**: a *security-token-randomness invariant* — a value used
   as a CSRF/OAuth `state` parameter must come from a real random source, not
   a static/derived value. This one **is** mechanically checkable: "is this
   variable, used as a `state`/`nonce`/CSRF-token parameter, assigned from a
   call to a recognized secure-random function or not" is a real, narrow,
   syntactic pattern.

Neither is what SonarQube/Semgrep/Bearer's free tiers do (single-location
pattern matching) or what paid taint analysis does (traces attacker-
controlled *input* to a dangerous *sink* — a different invariant entirely:
"don't let attacker data reach exec/query/eval unsanitized").

**What this means concretely**: off-the-shelf scanners are worth adding for
broad, generic coverage (typos, complexity, duplication, common CWE patterns,
secrets) — genuinely valuable, verified live below — but they will not close
this specific gap out of the box. Closing it needs two different things:

- A **narrow custom rule** for the token-randomness sub-class (buildable
  today in a pattern-matching DSL like Semgrep's — a few lines of YAML: flag
  any `state`/`csrf_token`/`nonce`-named parameter not assigned from a
  recognized RNG call).
- A **bespoke, project-aware check** for the asymmetric-cache-trust
  sub-class, in the same style as this codebase's existing
  `find_semantic_regressions` / `_detect_moved_code_blocks` (real AST/regex-
  anchored checks Aletheore already ships), not a generic tool — "does a
  corresponding invalidation path exist for the paired state transition" is
  project-aware, not a local syntactic pattern.

## SonarQube Community Build — tested live

**Setup**: `docker run -d --name sonarqube-test -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:community`
(version 26.9.0.129388), `brew install sonar-scanner` (8.1.0.6389), scanned
against a real PR-head checkout of grafana/grafana#103633 (base repo + the
real diff applied via `git apply`).

**License**: LGPL, true open source, free for commercial use. 17+ years old,
~11K GitHub stars, real large-scale adoption. Covers Go/TypeScript/Python (our
stack) plus 20+ languages total in the free Community Build. Excludes
C/C++/COBOL (commercial-only), irrelevant to us.

**Real scan results** (full Grafana monorepo, ~10,554 files, 4m20s scan +
~40s server processing):

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| Total issues | 15,846 |
| BUG | 552 |
| VULNERABILITY | 138 |
| CODE_SMELL | 15,156 |
| BLOCKER severity | 89 |
| CRITICAL severity | 2,335 |

**On the exact target file** (`pkg/services/authz/rbac/service.go`, where the
grafana-103633 bug lives): 4 issues, all pure code-quality smells (function
has 8 params, duplicated string literals). **Zero relevant to the golden
bug** — confirms the license/capability research exactly: no cross-function
trust-asymmetry checking in the free tier, no data-flow analysis of any kind
without a paid edition, and even paid taint analysis wouldn't have been the
right shape of check.

**One real, genuine side-catch**: lines 307-308 flagged two near-identical
duplicated string literals — `"unsupport resource"` (a real typo, missing
"ed") and `"unsupported resource"` (correct) — both used as literals multiple
times. None of the 8 LLMs tested tonight caught this, because it's exactly
the class of thing an LLM reviewer self-censors as "too minor to mention."
Real, concrete evidence of SonarQube's complementary value even though it
missed the target bug.

**Verdict**: real, mature, free, legitimate candidate for a broad
complementary deterministic layer. Not a fix for the specific gap that
motivated this evaluation.

## Semgrep — tested live

**Setup**: `pipx install semgrep` (1.177.0) — installed isolated via pipx
after a first attempt via `python3 -m pip install semgrep` corrupted the
shared environment (downgraded `mcp` below aletheore's `>=2.0` floor and
three `opentelemetry-*` packages pr-agent pins to exact versions; reverted
immediately, verified `flash_review.py`/`model_tiers.py` still import
cleanly afterward). Scanned the same target directory
(`pkg/services/authz/rbac/`) with `--config=auto` (1074 community rules
loaded, 131 applicable to Go, 42 files scanned).

**License**: LGPL-2.1 for the CE engine, true open source. Real note: a 2024
licensing controversy moved some components out of the permissive tier,
prompting a community fork (`Opengrep`) that preserves the original
permissive terms — worth knowing before depending on Semgrep's license
staying exactly where it is.

**Real scan result**: 1 finding — `go.lang.security.audit.xss.import-text-
template.import-text-template`, a generic WARNING that importing Go's
`text/template` package risks XSS if used to render untrusted content
(`pkg/services/authz/rbac/store/queries.go:6`). Legitimate generic finding,
**zero relevance** to the target bug. Confirms the single-file-only
architecture limitation from the earlier research: no rule category exists
for cross-function trust-asymmetry, free or paid.

## Bearer — tested live

**Setup**: `brew install bearer/tap/bearer` (2.1.1) — clean, self-contained
install, no dependency conflicts. Required git-tracked files to scan (errored
with "couldn't find any files to scan" against the untracked working tree;
resolved by committing the scratch checkout, which is disposable test-only
content, not real project history).

**License**: Elastic License v2 (ELv2) — source-available, **not** OSI-
approved open source, unlike SonarQube/Semgrep. Doesn't block internal use,
but worth flagging as a real difference in kind, not just degree.

**Real scan result**: 72 checks run (all of Bearer's default Go rules),
**zero failures detected**. This is Bearer working as designed, not a gap —
it's purpose-built for sensitive-data-flow/privacy compliance (PII, PHI,
GDPR/HIPAA-relevant data types), and a permission-cache implementation
legitimately has nothing in that category to find (it did detect exactly one
PII-adjacent data-type occurrence elsewhere in the scanned files, confirming
the detector itself is live and working). Correctly out of scope for this
bug class — the narrowest-purpose of the three tools tested.

## GitHub CodeQL — checked, disqualified on license (not tested live)

Pulled the real primary-source license text
(`raw.githubusercontent.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/main/LICENSE.md`),
not a secondhand summary, since this is a real compliance question. Two
clauses rule it out for Aletheore's actual business model, more decisively
than any of the three tools above:

1. Automated/CI/CD analysis is only permitted for an Open Source Codebase
   that is specifically "hosted and maintained on GitHub.com" - narrower
   than SonarQube/Semgrep/Bearer, none of which care where the repo lives.
2. The disqualifying clause: the license explicitly forbids using the
   Software to *"provide or make available the Software as a hosted
   solution (whether on a standalone basis or combined, incorporated or
   integrated with other software or services) for others to use."* That
   is a direct, explicit prohibition on exactly what Aletheore does -
   offering scan results as part of a hosted product to customers -
   regardless of whether the target repo is open source or private.

The only way around either restriction is a paid GitHub Advanced Security
license, which would have to be *the customer's* license for *their* repo,
not something Aletheore could rely on generally. **Not evaluated further -
no live test run, since the license rules out the real use case before any
technical evaluation would matter.**

## Joern — tested live, architecturally the most promising of everything checked

**Setup**: `docker pull ghcr.io/joernio/joern:master` (avoids a sudo system
install). Real Go frontend confirmed via `joern-parse --list-languages`
(`golang` is a first-class listed option, alongside swift/csharp/php/ruby/
rust/abap - broader than the pasted claim's language list even understated).
Built a real CPG (Code Property Graph) from the actual
`pkg/services/authz/rbac` package with `joern-parse --language golang`, then
queried it with a real `.sc` script via `joern --script`.

**License**: Apache License 2.0 - fully permissive, no commercial-use
restriction of any kind, confirmed directly from the GitHub repo's own
license field. The cleanest license of everything evaluated in this doc.

**Maturity**: real but smaller than SonarQube/Semgrep - 3,511 GitHub stars,
created 2019, actively maintained (pushed within a day of this evaluation),
321 open issues (real usage, not abandoned).

**Real query result**: `cpg.method.name("Check")` correctly located the
real `Check` method at the right line; `cpg.call.name("Get").where(_.method
.name("Check"))` correctly found exactly the `s.permDenialCache.Get(...)`
call and correctly did NOT conflate it with `getCachedIdentityPermissions`
(a differently-named call) - confirming the CPG genuinely captures real
per-call, per-method structure, not just text patterns.

**Why this matters more than the other three**: Joern queries the actual
control-flow/data-flow graph via a real Scala DSL - `reachableBy`,
control-dependence traversal, cross-function data flow - the same class of
capability that makes CodeQL/taint analysis powerful, without CodeQL's
license problem. This is architecturally the right *kind* of tool for the
asymmetric-cache-trust bug class (comparing whether two branches reach a
`return` node the same way is a real graph query, not a text pattern) in a
way SonarQube/Semgrep/Bearer's single-file pattern matching structurally
isn't.

**Honest limitation - not overclaiming this as done**: I confirmed the CPG
correctly represents the real code and that Joern's query language can
reach into it, but I did not write and validate a working query for the
actual asymmetric-trust pattern (the CFG/CDG traversal needed - "does every
path out of this cache-guard block reach a return" - is real, nontrivial
Joern DSL work). That's a distinct, larger engineering effort than the
Semgrep rule or the Python heuristic, both of which I built AND validated
end-to-end tonight. Worth real investment given the license and
architecture are both clean, but it is not a finished artifact the way the
other two are.

## Error Prone (Google) and Infer (Meta) — checked, real, but wrong languages for this gap

**Error Prone**: Apache-2.0, 7,237 GitHub stars, actively maintained
(pushed hours before this check), hooks directly into `javac` so it runs on
every build with no separate scan step. Java-only.

**Infer**: MIT, 15,707 GitHub stars, actively maintained, real and
sophisticated (separation logic for null derefs, memory leaks, concurrency
races). Confirmed it does **not** support Python or Go - Java, C, C++,
Objective-C, and Erlang only.

Neither covers Go or Python, the two languages both of this session's
target bugs live in, so neither could have caught either one - not tested
hands-on for that reason, same logic as skipping Bearer's PII-focused
scan on a permission-cache file. Real, mature, permissively licensed tools
regardless; see the recommendation below for why they're worth adding
anyway.

## PMD, SpotBugs, Phasar — checked, real, same category as Error Prone/Infer

**PMD**: BSD-style license (confirmed from the real LICENSE file, not just
GitHub's detector, which returned NOASSERTION on this repo), 5,493 stars,
actively maintained (pushed 2 days before this check). AST-based with a
genuinely low-friction custom-rule mechanism (XPath queries over the AST,
lighter-weight than Semgrep's pattern DSL for some rule shapes). Covers
Java, JavaScript, Apex, Scala, XML/HTML - no Go/Python.

**SpotBugs**: LGPL-2.1, 3,944 stars, actively maintained (pushed the day
before this check). FindBugs' successor, operates on compiled Java
bytecode rather than source - catches a different class of logic flaws
than source-level tools by construction. Java only.

**Phasar**: MIT (confirmed from the real LICENSE.txt - GitHub's detector
returned NOASSERTION here too, purely because the file isn't named the
standard `LICENSE`), 1,056 stars (smallest of everything checked, but real
and active - pushed 12 days before this check). Real interprocedural taint
analysis on LLVM bitcode. Does not practically cover our Go codebase - Go's
default toolchain doesn't emit LLVM IR without extra tooling (gollvm/
TinyGo) - so this is a C/C++-only candidate in practice despite the
LLVM-bitcode framing suggesting broader reach.

**WAP ("Web Application Protection") - checked, not recommended**: real
academic taint-analysis tool for PHP (SQL injection/XSS/file inclusion/
command injection), but it traces back to a 2015 IEEE journal paper,
ships on SourceForge, and shows no confirmed recent maintenance activity.
That's a real abandonment risk, not just a language-coverage gap like the
other tools above - didn't clear the same bar, so not adding it to the
integration list unless Aletheore develops a specific PHP-review need
that reopens the question.

None of these three cover Go or Python either, so none could have caught
either target bug - real, additive, permissively-licensed coverage for
Java/C/C++ repos specifically, same value proposition as Error Prone/
Infer, not tested hands-on for the same reason (wrong language for this
investigation's target bugs).

## gosec and Bandit — dedicated Go/Python security linters, tested/checked directly

Discovered indirectly: Horusec (below) turned out to be an orchestrator
wrapping these two, and they're more directly relevant on their own than
the orchestrator wrapping them - dedicated, mature, single-language
security scanners for exactly the two languages both target bugs live in.

**gosec**: Apache-2.0, 8,948 stars, actively maintained (pushed 4 days
before this check). **Tested live**: `go install
github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest`, ran against the real
`pkg/services/authz/rbac` package (11 files, 1,604 lines). Real result:
**0 issues** - gosec's rule set found nothing at all in this code, not
even an unrelated nitpick, confirming the same pattern as every other
tool tonight on this specific bug.

**Bandit**: Apache-2.0, 8,276 stars, actively maintained (pushed 3 weeks
before this check). Not tested hands-on (no real Python checkout of the
sentry-67876 case exists locally the way the Go grafana-103633 checkout
does), but same category and same expected result as gosec by
architecture - AST-level pattern matching, not cross-function/control-flow
analysis.

Both real, additive, dedicated candidates for the language-specific layer
- narrower and more precisely targeted than SonarQube/Semgrep's
multi-language rule sets for Go/Python specifically, worth having
alongside them, not instead of them.

## Orchestrators and adjacent tools — Mega-Linter, Super-Linter, Horusec, AppThreat/sast-scan, DefectDojo, Graudit, Trivy

**Mega-Linter**: real license correction needed - the pasted claim said
MIT; GitHub's own classifier and the actual LICENSE file both confirm
**AGPL-3.0**. This matters for a hosted product specifically: AGPL's
network-use clause (Section 13) can require disclosing your own service's
complete source if you run AGPL code as part of it. Real legal exposure
question, not a simple license-compatibility one - needs real legal
review before any integration, not just noting the license tier.

**Super-Linter** (MIT, 10,600 stars, active) and **Horusec** (Apache-2.0,
1,340 stars, active, not archived): both confirmed to be **orchestrators
that wrap other existing tools** (Super-Linter wraps golangci-lint/
hadolint/actionlint/etc.; Horusec wraps 20+ SAST engines including gosec
and Bandit themselves). Real implication for Aletheore specifically:
since the integration plan already calls for building custom orchestration
(the `security.static_analysis` evidence schema, per the scoping doc) to
get results into Aletheore's own finding shape and merge logic, adopting
a generic orchestrator's own opinionated output format would need about
as much adapter work as calling the underlying tools directly - the
convenience these tools sell (one drop-in CI gate) isn't really the
problem Aletheore has.

**AppThreat/sast-scan**: the pasted description ("exceptionally
powerful") didn't mention that GitHub confirms this repo is **archived**,
last pushed 2020-09-04 - over 6 years dead. Not viable, full stop.

**DefectDojo**: real, BSD-3-Clause, very active (pushed the same day as
this check), 4,949 stars - but it's a vulnerability management/dashboard
application (Django-based, its own database), not a scanner. Its actual
job (dedupe and track findings across many tools) is what Aletheore's own
evidence schema is already being built to do for its specific needs -
redundant with planned work, not a detection source.

**Graudit**: real, GPL-3.0 (confirmed - not AGPL), 1,689 stars, maintained
(pushed ~9 months before this check, slower-moving than the others but not
abandoned). Worth a real license distinction: GPL's copyleft obligations
generally attach to distributing/linking the code, not to invoking it as
a separate CLI subprocess - a materially different risk profile than
Mega-Linter's AGPL - but that's my own reasoning, not a substitute for
real legal sign-off before shipping anything built on it. Architecturally
just curated grep-pattern signature databases (the pasted description's
own framing - "extended grep" - is accurate), same single-location
pattern-matching category as everything else, not expected to touch
either target bug.

**Trivy**: real, Apache-2.0, the largest tool checked tonight by far
(37,993 stars), extremely active (pushed 2 days before this check). Real
but *different in kind* from everything else in this doc: container
image/SBOM/IaC (Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation) and dependency-
vulnerability scanning, not source-code logic analysis. Directly relevant
to evidence categories Aletheore **already has and populates** today -
`security.dependency_vulnerabilities` (currently OSV.dev-based, see
`vulnerabilities.py`), `security.secrets`, `repository.infrastructure` -
a real candidate to evaluate as an upgrade/replacement for those existing
checks specifically, not as a new category alongside the others in this
doc.

## YASA, LiSA, Reviewdog — checked, real, two more graph-based candidates plus real PR-comment infrastructure

**YASA-Engine** (Ant Group): real, confirmed at `github.com/antgroup/
YASA-Engine`, Apache-2.0, 323 stars, not archived (last pushed ~5 weeks
before this check). Architecturally in the same family as Joern - a
unified cross-language graph representation (UAST, not CPG), real
built-in taint analysis, a declarative query language, and - notably -
native MCP exposure per its own README, directly relevant given
Aletheore's own MCP server. Real but young (created September 2025) and
smaller/slower-moving than Joern's community - a real lead worth deeper
evaluation, not hands-on tested tonight given the time already spent
validating Joern as the flagship graph-based candidate.

**LiSA**: real, MIT, but genuinely tiny - 85 stars, smallest of every
tool checked in this entire evaluation. Real academic-scale project
(Python/Go/Java/EVM-bytecode frontends into a shared CFG, abstract
interpretation for formal verification) - the architecture is
interesting, but the community size is a real, honest maintenance-risk
flag distinct from anything else recommended in this doc.

**Reviewdog**: real, MIT, 9,602 stars, very active - genuinely different
role from every other tool here. It's not a detector at all; it's the
piece that takes any linter's diagnostic output and posts it as precise
line-level PR/MR comments on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket. This is a direct,
real candidate for the open integration question the scoping doc flagged
and never answered: "how do results surface in PR comments" - Reviewdog
may be a real, mature, off-the-shelf answer to exactly that, rather than
something Aletheore needs to build from scratch.

## Open Code Review (Alibaba) — a different kind of finding: a real, mature competing product, not a tool to integrate

This is not a scanner to bolt on. It's a real, mature, directly
competing hybrid deterministic+LLM PR review product - worth understanding
as a peer/competitor, the same way this session studied CodeRabbit's real
architecture earlier tonight, not as a fourteenth entry in the
integration list.

**Real and legitimate, verified past the surface-level star count**: 38,308
stars is unusually fast growth for a repo created 2026-05-18 (~4 months
before this check) - real enough to warrant scrutiny before trusting it,
which the actual README answers: it originated as Alibaba's internal
official AI code review tool, in real production for **two years**
("served tens of thousands of developers and identified millions of code
defects") before being open-sourced - the star velocity reflects a
proven internal tool's public launch, not an inflated new project.
Apache-2.0, confirmed from the real LICENSE file. OpenSSF Best Practices
Gold badge (a real, third-party-administered certification, not
self-claimed).

**Real, rigorous benchmark**: AACR-Bench - 50 real open-source repos, 200
real PRs, 10 languages, cross-validated by 80+ senior engineers, 1,505
annotated ground-truth issues, published openly on Hugging Face
(`Alibaba-Aone/aacr-bench`) - directly comparable in spirit and rigor to
this session's own Martian Code Review Bench work tonight, and a real,
independently-checkable dataset if a future direct comparison against
Aletheore is ever worth running.

**Real architectural techniques worth studying, not copying blind**:
- *Smart file bundling*: groups related files (their own example:
  `message_en.properties` + `message_zh.properties`) into one review
  unit handled by an isolated sub-agent - a divide-and-conquer approach
  to large changesets, structurally different from Aletheore's current
  per-diff single-pass generation.
- *External positioning and reflection modules*: separate, dedicated
  passes specifically for comment-location accuracy and comment-content
  accuracy, independent of the main review generation - a more granular
  split than Aletheore's current single second-model verification step
  (`_verify_findings_with_second_model`), which conflates "is this
  finding real" with "is it positioned/worded well" into one pass.
- Their own published claim (from their own benchmark, not
  independently reproduced here): ~1/9 the token cost of a general-purpose
  coding agent doing the same review, at higher precision/F1, with lower
  recall as an explicit, deliberate tradeoff - the same precision-vs-
  recall tension this session's whole night of model comparisons has been
  wrestling with, approached from the opposite side (favor precision,
  accept recall loss) of where tonight's investigation has been pushing
  (favor recall, accept the two specific misses).

Not recommended for integration - it's a peer product, not a library or
scanner. Worth a closer, dedicated look (the AACR-Bench dataset
specifically) if there's appetite to benchmark Aletheore against it
directly, the way tonight's session benchmarked against CodeRabbit's real
architecture and the Martian gold set.

## Recommendation

Twenty-four tools/products checked total. Eight excluded or set aside:
CodeQL (license), WAP (abandonment risk), AppThreat/sast-scan (archived,
6 years dead), Mega-Linter (real AGPL-3.0 correction from the pasted MIT
claim - blocked pending real legal review), Super-Linter/Horusec/
DefectDojo (orchestrators/aggregators, redundant with Aletheore's own
planned orchestration work), and LiSA (real but too small - 85 stars -
to recommend alongside everything else here, a lead to revisit rather
than integrate now). Open Code Review is a separate case entirely - not
excluded, just not a fit for "integration list" at all; see above. The
other fifteen (the original thirteen plus YASA and Reviewdog) confirmed
real, legitimate, and worth the integration list. None caught either target bug, and none were
ever going to - reachable from license/architecture research alone, live
runs just confirm it with real data. Per direction: the goal isn't only
closing this one gap, it's Aletheore getting generally better, so tools
that can't touch this specific bug class are still worth adding for their
own real, independent coverage:

- **SonarQube**: broadest general-purpose coverage (bugs, code smells,
  duplication, complexity, generic vulnerability patterns) across the whole
  repo — real value demonstrated live (a genuine typo/duplicated-error-string
  bug at grafana-103633's service.go:307-308 that none of the 8 LLMs tested
  tonight bothered to flag). Best fit as the broad baseline layer.
- **Semgrep**: narrower out-of-the-box registry coverage than SonarQube on
  this sample, but the lowest-friction path to **custom rules** (plain YAML
  pattern DSL) — the right vehicle for the one sub-class from this
  investigation that's actually mechanically checkable: flagging a
  `state`/`csrf_token`/`nonce`-shaped variable that isn't assigned from a
  recognized secure-random call.
- **Bearer**: narrowest scope of the six (privacy/sensitive-data flows
  specifically) — real value only on repos that actually handle PII/PHI:
  worth having if/when Aletheore reviews code touching user data, not
  generally applicable to every PR the way the others are.
- **Joern**: cleanest license (Apache 2.0) and the only one architecturally
  capable of real cross-function control-flow/data-flow queries - the
  actual right *kind* of tool for the asymmetric-trust bug class, confirmed
  hands-on against the real Go code. **Update**: the query is now built and
  validated - real CFG-based classification (does every path out of a
  cache-guard block reach a RETURN, via actual graph traversal, not text
  proximity), fires correctly on the real grafana-103633 bug after fixing
  three real bugs found live (a `forall`-vs-`exists` CFG-escape logic
  error, a call-name-vs-full-code-text matching gap that missed the real
  `permDenialCache.Get` call, and a false positive matching metrics calls
  merely named `permissionCacheUsage`), and zero false positives across
  the other 3 real Go repos in this session's corpus (one hit found, but
  on code outside that diff entirely - the known, not-yet-built,
  diff-scoping gap, not a logic bug). Still not wired into production -
  that's the same real orchestration work as the Semgrep rule needs.
- **Error Prone**, **Infer**, **PMD**, **SpotBugs**, **Phasar**: real,
  mature, permissively licensed, zero relevance to either target bug
  (Java/C/C++ only, no Go/Python), but genuinely additive general coverage
  for any Java/C/C++ repos Aletheore reviews - same value proposition as
  SonarQube, narrower and more specialized (Error Prone compiles-in via
  javac with a very low false-positive rate per its own design goals;
  Infer catches deep bugs like null derefs/concurrency races SonarQube's
  pattern rules don't reach; PMD's XPath rule DSL is a lighter-weight
  custom-rule path than Semgrep's for some shapes; SpotBugs operates on
  compiled bytecode rather than source; Phasar does real interprocedural
  taint analysis on LLVM bitcode, practically C/C++-only). WAP checked and
  excluded - real abandonment risk (2015 academic origin, SourceForge-
  hosted, no confirmed recent maintenance), a different kind of problem
  than a language-coverage gap.
- **gosec** and **Bandit**: dedicated Go/Python security linters - the
  most directly relevant of this batch by language, but architecturally
  the same single-location pattern-matching category as everything else.
  gosec tested live against the real target code: 0 issues, confirming it
  by measurement, not just by category.
- **Graudit**: real, maintained, GPL-3.0 - get real legal sign-off on the
  subprocess-invocation distinction noted above before relying on it, not
  just this doc's reasoning. Curated grep-signature coverage, cheap to run,
  same category as everything else for detection depth.
- **Trivy**: not really the same kind of tool as the rest of this list -
  evaluate it specifically as a real upgrade path for Aletheore's existing
  `security.dependency_vulnerabilities`/`security.secrets`/
  `repository.infrastructure` evidence sections (currently OSV.dev-based),
  not as a fourteenth entry in the source-code-logic-bug category.

**"Pull all in" is a reasonable plan** if the goal is broad, complementary,
battle-tested deterministic coverage layered under/alongside LLM review —
genuinely additive, not overlapping, and explicitly not gated on solving
the one gap that started this investigation. That gap still needs the two
custom checks described in "What we actually need" above (both now built
and validated - see `_asymmetric_cache_trust_findings_go` in
`semantic_checks.py` and `oauth-state-not-random.yaml`), plus real future
investment in a Joern query if the asymmetric-trust pattern needs to
generalize beyond Go. Integration design (how six tools' results surface in
PR comments and AIRview, how findings get deduplicated against LLM findings
and against each other, cost/latency of running six real scanners per
review or scan) is real, separate work not scoped by this evaluation.

## Open Code Review's real orchestration prompts — read directly from source, Apache-2.0

Confirmed via the actual repo (not the README's prose) that "deterministic
engineering" has no standalone rule engine - `internal/` has no `rules/`,
`checkers/`, or `staticanalysis/` package. What it does have is a real,
multi-stage LLM pipeline, each stage its own small, narrowly-scoped prompt
(`internal/config/template/task_template.json` dispatches to separate
`.md` prompt files per stage). Quoted here in full - Apache-2.0 permits
this, and it's real reference material for the "build" side of the split
below, not creative content.

**MAIN_TASK system prompt** (`main_task_system.md`) - the actual review
generation prompt, notably tool-call-driven (`code_comment`/`task_done`
tools) rather than PR-Agent/Aletheore's single structured-YAML response:

> Review every file listed in `<review_files>` individually. Cross-file
> observations within `<review_files>` are encouraged — look for
> inconsistencies, missing updates, and broken contracts across related
> files... Before calling `task_done`, confirm you have given every
> `<file>` in `<review_files>` its own pass. Reviewing an implementation
> file does not cover its header, interface, or configuration
> counterpart — a file being the smaller or secondary member of the
> group is not a reason to skip it.

That completeness-forcing instruction directly targets the "incomplete
coverage" failure mode their own README calls out in general-purpose
agents - a real, specific, adoptable prompt technique.

**REVIEW_FILTER_TASK system prompt** (`review_filter_task_system.md`) -
their real "reflection" module, and the most interesting find in this
whole doc. It's not a generic verifier; it has an explicit, asymmetric-
risk philosophy:

> Your task is narrow: remove only the comments that this diff **proves**
> to be factually wrong... The two mistakes available to you are not
> equally bad: Keeping an incorrect comment costs a reviewer a few
> seconds of attention. Removing a correct comment silently destroys a
> real finding. It never reaches anyone, and nobody learns that it was
> dropped. So when your evidence falls short of proof, approve.

This is a materially different stance from Aletheore's own
`VERIFICATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (ACCEPT/REJECT/UNCERTAIN, no explicit
asymmetric-cost framing) and directly relevant to a real problem this
session hit tonight independently: the verification model sometimes
over-credits or wrongly rejects findings without this kind of explicit
"burden of proof" instruction. Worth a direct, real comparison against
Aletheore's own verification prompt, not just noting it exists.

**GROUPING_TASK system prompt** (`grouping_task_system.md`) - the real
"smart file bundling," confirmed to be an LLM call, not deterministic
logic:

> Files in the same group typically: Belong to the same module/feature;
> Have producer/consumer relationships (e.g. interface and
> implementation); Are i18n/config variants of the same resource (e.g.
> `message_en.properties` and `message_zh.properties`); Share the same
> directory and work together on a single concern.

**RE_LOCATION_TASK** (`re_location_task_system.md`) - a tiny, cheap,
narrowly-scoped call (their own prompt appends `/no_think`, explicitly
disabling reasoning mode for speed/cost) whose only job is extracting the
exact verbatim snippet a comment refers to, fixing the "position drift"
problem their README names. A real, minimal, portable pattern: a small
dedicated correction call is cheaper and more reliable than asking the
main review call to also self-verify its own line numbers.

## Everything from this investigation, sorted: drag in vs. build ourselves

**Drag in directly** (real dependencies/binaries to call, Apache-2.0/MIT/
BSD/LGPL-2.1, no code to write beyond the integration plumbing already
scoped in `deterministic_scanner_integration_scope.md`): SonarQube,
Semgrep, Bearer, Joern, Error Prone, Infer, PMD, SpotBugs, Phasar, gosec,
Bandit, Graudit (pending real legal sign-off on the GPL-3.0 subprocess
question), Reviewdog (for the PR-comment-posting question specifically),
Trivy (for the existing dependency-vulnerability/secrets/infrastructure
evidence sections specifically, not as a new category). YASA is a real
lead worth a deeper look before deciding drag-in vs. not - same
architectural family as Joern, not yet hands-on validated.

**Build ourselves, inspired by real prior art, no code imported**:
- The two custom checks this session already built and validated
  (`_asymmetric_cache_trust_findings_go`, `oauth-state-not-random.yaml`)
  - the actual gap that started this whole investigation, and nothing
    checked tonight, dragged in or otherwise, closes it out of the box.
- Open Code Review's multi-stage pipeline shape (plan → group → review →
  filter → relocate) as a real alternative architecture to compare
  against Aletheore's current single-call generation + optional single
  verification pass in `flash_review.py`.
- Their `GROUPING_TASK` prompt idea - semantic file bundling before
  review, not per-diff single-pass - reimplemented as an Aletheore
  prompt/call, not their Go code.
- Their `REVIEW_FILTER_TASK` asymmetric-risk verification philosophy -
  the strongest single idea from this whole exploration - worth directly
  rewriting into `VERIFICATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and measuring the effect,
  the same rigor this session applied to every other prompt change
  tonight.
- Their `RE_LOCATION_TASK` pattern - a small, cheap, dedicated
  correction call for comment positioning specifically, if Aletheore ever
  measures a real position-drift problem worth a dedicated fix rather
  than folding into the main generation prompt.
- Not recommended to copy: their completeness-forcing "review every file
  individually" framing assumes a per-file tool-call loop; Aletheore's
  current single-shot-YAML shape would need real redesign, not a prompt
  patch, to use it the same way.
