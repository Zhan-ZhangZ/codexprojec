# Deployment Verification

**Purpose:** Define the minimum verification required before treating hosted deployment as current.
**Status:** Active baseline
**Owner:** Arihant Kaul
**Related Documents:** [README.md](README.md), [INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md](INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md), [../../github-app/README.md](../../github-app/README.md)
**Last Updated:** 2026-10-09
**Snapshot Freshness:** CURRENT as of 2026-10-09 - the scan workers, `health-worker` and `scheduler` run
`master` at commit `9cf6f24e` (tag `github-app-deploy-2026-10-09-5`); `app-server` and `jina-embed` still run
`e3182a9f` from the 2026-10-08 deploy below, because nothing under `github-app/app_server/` or
`github-app/jina_embed/` changed after it, so a rebuild would have produced the same code. Re-verified live
via SSH after each step. No migration, no Dockerfile or compose change, no lockfile change in any of these.

Five worker-only deploys on 2026-10-09, each built from `master` and rolled one container at a time, waiting
for that worker to be idle first so no running job was killed:

1. `b3fc4796` (#991), tag `github-app-deploy-2026-10-09`: the managed-audit string-evidence path wrote
   `air.toon` before `air.json`, so `ensure_air_toon` could rebuild the real evidence from the placeholder
   JSON right before the LLM read it (a timestamp race, now pinned by a job-level test), plus `find_secrets`
   with a relative repository path. Also brought the version string to 0.9.23.
2. `b5292bb1` (#995), tag `github-app-deploy-2026-10-09-2`: an unused import in `cli.py`. No behaviour change.
3. `8ef4e232` (#998), tag `github-app-deploy-2026-10-09-3`: a parse worker killed outright (OOM-killer,
   SIGKILL, segfault) no longer aborts the scan. Finished results are kept, the unfinished files are retried in
   a fresh pool with half the workers, and if a single worker still dies the secret and error-handling stages
   fail with an error rather than reporting files that were never scanned as clean (they cache per file, so an invented
   "no findings" would have been remembered). `health-worker` and `scheduler` were rolled onto this build too,
   so no service runs older `scan_worker` or `aletheore` code than the workers do; their previous images
   predated all three changes.
4. `e79f3c73` (#1002), tag `github-app-deploy-2026-10-09-4`: `history_depth_limited` was derived from the cap
   the current call asked for, so a later call with a different cap reported a capped graph as complete; it now
   compares the commits the persisted graph holds with the repository's total (reproduced and checked on a
   1,559-commit repository, including merge commits and a bot author). The in-memory file-hash cache is now
   bounded (200,000 entries, oldest evicted first) and survives a concurrent eviction. The scan workers,
   `health-worker` and `scheduler` were all rolled; the changes live in the `aletheore` package they all
   install. Brought `aletheore.__version__` to 0.9.24 in the running containers (the version string of the
   release published earlier that day).
5. `9cf6f24e` (#1007), tag `github-app-deploy-2026-10-09-5`: the published wheel and the worker image left out
   the semgrep rules and the Joern query, and `check_semgrep` passed the missing rules folder to semgrep, so
   semgrep always exited with an error and was reported as "did not run". The files are now packaged (a test
   fails if any data file is missing from the package-data list) and a missing folder no longer fails the run.
   Hosted behaviour is deliberately unchanged: semgrep measured about 270 seconds on a large repository with a
   timeout that scales to 30 minutes, so the worker sets `ALETHEORE_DISABLE_SEMGREP=1` and a hosted scan now
   reports "semgrep disabled" instead of an error. `ALETHEORE_HOSTED_ENABLE_SEMGREP` (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`)
   opts in. The scan workers, `health-worker` and `scheduler` were rolled idle-first (no busy RQ worker at any
   step). Released to PyPI the same day as 0.9.26; a clean-venv install of 0.9.26 contains the rules and the
   Joern query.


Verified live: `docker ps` shows exactly `github-app-scan-worker-1` and `github-app-scan-worker-2-1`, all six
app services `healthy`; zero lines matching `error|traceback|exception` in the logs of every recreated
container since its restart; `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`;
and the new code is in the *running* containers, not just the checkout (after the fifth deploy, in all four
recreated containers: `jobs.py` has `_hosted_semgrep_enabled`, it returns false by default, and `check_semgrep` returns
"semgrep disabled" under `ALETHEORE_DISABLE_SEMGREP`; after the fourth deploy, in all four
recreated containers: the file-hash cache is an `OrderedDict` capped at 200,000 and `prepare_git_analysis`
compares the stored commit count with the total; earlier: `air.json` is written before
`air.toon` in the workers' `jobs.py`, `find_secrets` resolves the path first, `cli.py` has no `import re`,
`_map_in_pool_with_recovery` is present in `scanner/graph.py` and used by the secrets and error-handling
stages in the workers, `health-worker` and `scheduler`).

The server's `github-app/.env.bak-pre-sentry-<timestamp>` that the 2026-10-08 entry below says to delete was
deleted on 2026-10-09 at the operator's request; the live `.env` (mode 600, with the Sentry settings) is
unchanged. Changes in this window that do not run on the server and were not deployed here: CI and dev-tooling
(#992, #994, #997) and the marketing site (#990, which deploys itself on merge).

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-10-08 - production was redeployed to `master` (commit
`e3182a9f`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-10-08`) and re-verified live via SSH the same session.
238 commits (70 merged PRs) since the previous deploy (`6e921475`, 2026-10-04). All six app services
were rebuilt and recreated, including `jina-embed`, which had not been rebuilt since 2026-09-26.

What changed in production, grouped (PR numbers are the merged ones; `git log 6e921475..e3182a9f`
is the exact range):

- **Money and billing:** AIRview's shared spend-reservation scalar leaked money across worker threads
  (#917), the overnight audit's three bugs including a crash-leak sweep for held reservations (#918),
  a Paddle paid-setup claim consumed even when setup failed (#947), affiliate creation orphaning a live
  Paddle discount (#958), seat buy and remove idempotency (#975).
- **Flash Review:** a transient GitHub error no longer aborts the whole review (#921), per-file findings
  cap scales (#923), cache-hit findings get the cross-file re-check (#924), patch reconstruction no
  longer fails open (#946), incremental reviews no longer post on merged-in code, falsely resolve
  untouched findings, or review files outside the PR (#968, #971), and the shared-state semantic check
  stopped firing on constructors and imports (#987).
- **Webhooks and platform:** login no longer 500s during a GitHub outage (#945), `/aletheore audit` and
  `/dismiss` inside a code block no longer fire (#949, #980), org-wide install no longer blocks the event
  loop (#948) and retries a failed repo enumeration (#974), check-run idempotency and rate-limit backoff
  (#976), embedding provider switch and embeddings-token usage fixes (#953, #954).
- **Scanners (the code the workers run):** CVE scanning now sees nested npm lockfile dependencies, legacy
  lockfile v1, Maven property chains and Composer dev dependencies (#934, #938, #939, #940); git
  analysis fixes for rewritten history, deleted files, shallow clones and renames (#937, #950, #951,
  #977); and the large-repo scan performance work (#985), which also adds the per-file cache and the
  default 50k and 20k history caps to local scans (hosted already used them).
- **Security and infrastructure:** PMD 7.28.0 closes CVE-2026-75140 (jsoup) in the scan-worker image
  (#964), semgrep now lives in its own venv with a patched protobuf (#962), plus the Dependabot bumps
  that merged in the window.
- **Observability:** Sentry error tracking across `app_server`, `scan_worker` and `jina_embed` (#961), with
  a fix so a logged exception that also alerts is reported once, not twice (#978).

One new migration, `072_llm_spend_reservations.sql` (additive and idempotent: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
EXISTS` plus an index), which the new reservation sweep job needs. Order of operations, chosen for that
dependency: a fresh Postgres backup first (`backups/aletheore_app_2026-10-08T18-32-15Z.dump`, taken with
`scripts/backup-postgres.sh`), `git reset --hard origin/master`, build all six images (exit 0, no errors),
then `app-server` alone first so the migration was applied before any worker ran the new code, then the
two scan workers, `health-worker`, `scheduler` and `jina-embed`, using `up -d --no-deps` and no `--scale`.

Verified live the same session: `docker ps` shows exactly `github-app-scan-worker-1` and
`github-app-scan-worker-2-1`, with `app-server`, both workers, `health-worker`, `scheduler` and
`jina-embed` all `healthy` within about 25 seconds of recreation; zero lines matching
`error|traceback|exception` in any of the six services' logs since restart; `/healthz` returns
`200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`; `schema_migrations` shows `072` as the newest row and
`to_regclass('public.llm_spend_reservations')` resolves; and the new code is in the *running* containers,
not just the checkout (`reviewed_scope` in `scan_worker/jobs.py` x12, `_callable_handed_to_concurrency`
in `semantic_checks.py`, `already_captured` in `error_alerts.py`, `webhooks/comment_commands.py`
present, `aletheore.git_intel.history_meta`, `file_cache` and `sentry_reporting` import cleanly,
semgrep 1.179.0 and PMD 7.28.0 on `PATH`).

**Sentry is live.** `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production` were added to the server's
`github-app/.env` (the backend project, separate from the CLI's own project) before the services were
recreated, so one restart picked them up; `jina-embed` receives them through compose interpolation of the
same file. All six containers have `SENTRY_DSN` set. A logged test exception from inside the running
`app-server` container (`init_sentry("deploy-smoke")`, SDK active, environment `production`,
`send_default_pii` false) and a direct ingest request from the same container (HTTP 200) confirm the
path to Sentry works from production. The server keeps `github-app/.env.bak-pre-sentry-<timestamp>`
(mode 600, the file as it was before this edit); delete it when it is no longer needed, since it holds
secrets. Rollback is `git reset --hard 6e921475`, rebuild and recreate; migration `072` is additive
and needs no undo.

Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile or host changes beyond the scan-worker tool
versions above): Docker socket mount absence, non-root users, CPU and memory limits, backup cron
execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill target availability.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-10-04 - production was redeployed to `master` (commit
`6e921475`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-10-04`) and re-verified live via SSH the same session.
This file's own tracking had drifted from reality before this deploy: the previous header entry
below (tag `github-app-deploy-2026-09-30-2`, commit `f11d1bbe`) was stale, and the "Current Server
Snapshot" section further down (dated 2026-10-02, commit `efa1f0e`) was also stale - direct SSH
inspection found the server actually running commit `55233d34` (#906), several commits past both
recorded snapshots, with no record of when or how it got there. Treat the header above, not either
of those two sections, as authoritative going forward; both are left below for history rather than
corrected, since reconstructing the untracked deploy(s) between them isn't possible from this
session.

18 commits since the actual previous commit (`55233d34`): five merged PRs plus one pre-existing
fix already on master. **#913** - migrates AIRview, Docs, managed audits, and endpoint-health fix
suggestions to IndieRouter (`deepseek-v4.1-flash` / `glm-5.3-flash`) as primary, with unchanged
fallback to the previous direct providers; live-verified end to end against real IndieRouter
credits for all four surfaces before merge (AIRview: a real module wrapped in one synthetic
cluster, since this repo's evidence has no computed clusters yet, produced a correct, cited
subsystem description for $0.0019; Docs: all 5 real undocumented functions in
`audit_signing.py` got correct descriptions for $0.0004; managed audits and health-fix suggestions
verified in earlier sessions). **#909** - bounds the audit's evidence reads (a single read could
return ~1M characters, driving one audit to 4.5-4.9M input tokens and real OpenAI rate-limit
failures); now pages or outlines anything over 30,000 chars, measured 5-10x cost reduction on this
repo. **#911** - adds `repository.error_handling` evidence (raise/catch sites per language) and an
AIRview paragraph on it, measured +0.61 overall vs the +0.59 baseline on a 12-question judged
corpus. **#912** - six real bugs from a backward audit of PRs since the last sweep (a rename-aware
diff never wired in, a Paddle webhook TTL gap, an affiliate-commission proration bug, AIR/Flash
page-gating, a stale "Tests" subsystem cache, an overly-narrow Bandit regex). **#910** - removes
the already-disabled second-model verification path (dead code, no behavior change in production).
One new migration (`071_affiliate_commission_partial_reversal.sql`, additive and idempotent -
`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, a backfill `UPDATE` that is a no-op on rows it's already run against,
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`). All five app-relevant services (`app-server`, `scan-worker`,
`scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, `scheduler`) rebuilt and force-recreated; all five `Up` and
Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~15 seconds of recreation. Zero errors, tracebacks, or
exceptions in any of the five services' logs in the 3 minutes since restart. Migration confirmed
applied in Postgres, not just logged: `schema_migrations` shows `071_affiliate_commission_partial_
reversal.sql` as the newest row, and `\d affiliate_commissions` shows the real `charged_total_minor`
and `reversed_usd` columns. `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok",
"redis":"ok"}}`. Every PR's own fix confirmed present in the *running* `scan-worker` container's
actual source, not re-read from the repo: `model_tiers.INDIEROUTER_DEEPSEEK_MODEL ==
"deepseek-v4.1-flash"`, `writing_adapter_for_docs`/`writing_adapter_for_health_fix_suggestion`
importable, `verification_adapter` gone; `aletheore.evidence_view.MAX_SECTION_CHARS == 30000`;
`aletheore.error_handling` importable. The privacy-policy wording fix (#913's own follow-up,
"three of them are not evidence") deploys independently via Vercel and was separately confirmed
live at `www.aletheore.com/privacy` - not part of this docker stack. Not re-verified this pass (no
relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence, non-root users, CPU/mem limits,
backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill target availability, disk space.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-30 (second deploy) - production was redeployed to
`master` (commit `f11d1bbe`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-30-2`) and re-verified live via SSH
the same session. 1 commit since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-30`): #881, a
Mermaid dependency-graph diagram (changed files -> their direct dependents, GitHub-native
rendering, no image generation or hosting needed) added to the PR evidence-diff comment, right
before the existing text "What changed" file overview - the diagram gives the shape, the text
gives the exact detail. Built entirely from data already computed today
(`blast_radius_summary.compute_blast_radius`'s already-deterministic direct-dependent data, the
diff's already-computed `static_analysis["new"]` to mark a changed file with a new finding
distinctly) - no new computation or failure mode, fails open like the file-overview section it
sits alongside. One real Flash Review finding on the PR itself, fixed before merge: a bare
basename (e.g. `utils.py`) couldn't distinguish `src/utils.py` from `tests/utils.py`, so colliding
nodes would render identically-labeled with no way to tell them apart - fixed to fall back to the
full path only for paths whose basename collides with another node in the same diagram, verified
via a new RED-then-GREEN test reproducing the exact collision. No migrations; no lockfile changes.
All five app-relevant services (`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`,
`scheduler`) rebuilt and force-recreated - `src/aletheore` and `scan_worker/jobs.py` both changed;
`jina-embed` untouched (no lockfile change of its own). All five `Up`, all five reporting
Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~25 seconds of recreation. Zero errors, tracebacks, or
exceptions in any of the five services' logs in the 30 seconds since restart. `/healthz` returns
`200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`. The fix (including the basename-
collision disambiguation) confirmed present in the *running* `scan-worker` container's actual
source, not re-read from the repo: `blast_radius_summary.build_change_diagram` importable, its
source contains `basename_counts` (the collision-disambiguation fix) and the Mermaid fence marker.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-30 (first deploy) - production was redeployed to `master`
(commit `9be2a34`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-30`) and re-verified live via SSH the same
session. 4 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-29`): #874 (fixes a self-
referenced delegate in a C# file being counted against its own type-reference edge cap, crowding
out real cross-file edges - the same bug independently found in two different code shapes,
`src/aletheore/scanner/graph.py`), #878 and #879 (identical fix in two places -
`search_index._is_test_path` and `dead_code.py`'s own test-path check - both missed PHP/Swift/Scala
co-located test-file naming, e.g. `BarTest.php`, `BarTests.swift`, having only ever been extended
for the JVM shape), and #877 (AIRview now synthesizes a dedicated "Tests" subsystem instead of just
ranking-demoting individual test files 0.15x, so "how is this codebase tested" questions have a
subsystem-shaped answer to retrieve - closes the one real, measured quality gap found via a
36-question blind benchmark against RepoWise; live-verified for real after merge, not just
unit-tested: Testing-category delta flipped from -1.778 to +1.222 on Flask, and a second,
internal old-vs-new check on automapper (C#, 82% test files) showed +1.111, confirming the fix
generalizes across languages, not just architecturally but empirically - see
`~/.aletheore-bench/airview-tests-subsystem-verification-2026-09-30/` for the full writeup). No
migrations; the only lockfile change was an already-merged, unrelated pyjwt bump
(2.14.0 -> 2.15.0, #862). All five app-relevant services (`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
`health-worker`, `scheduler`) rebuilt and force-recreated - `src/aletheore` changed (pip-installed
by all five) and `scan_worker/live_wiki.py` changed directly (#877); `jina-embed` untouched (no
lockfile change of its own). All five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within
~34 seconds of recreation. Zero errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in any of the five services' logs
in the 60 seconds since restart. `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok",
"redis":"ok"}}`. All four fixes confirmed present in the *running* `scan-worker` container's actual
source, not re-read from the repo: `live_wiki.TESTS_SUBSYSTEM_ID == -1`,
`live_wiki.TESTS_SUBSYSTEM_NAME == "Tests"`, and `_build_tests_subsystem_brief` importable (#877);
`search_index._COLOCATED_TEST_SUFFIX_RE.pattern` includes `php|swift|scala` (#878); `dead_code.py`'s
source contains the same `php|swift|scala` pattern (#879); `graph.py`'s source shows
`own_type_names = set(_csharp_declared_type_names(...))` (#874).

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-29 - production was redeployed to `master` (commit
`8288446`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-29`) and re-verified live via SSH the same session. 1
commit since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-28-2`): #859, a real fix to
Aletheore's own hosted Deterministic Scan (Bandit's B608 SQL-injection rule) - its SQL-shape regex
paired an `update` keyword with a `set` keyword using an unbounded `.*` under `re.DOTALL`, so it
matched across arbitrary distance in a file; reproduced live against the real `bandit` binary,
where it paired the word "update" in a code comment with the JS identifier `nodeSet` roughly 5,700
characters later in `frontend.py`'s `WIKI_HTML` - a large f-string with no SQL involved anywhere in
that module, and the exact false positive that had been repeatedly flagging PR #858. Fix: a new
`_sql_injection_is_plausible()` AST re-check on B608 findings only, requiring a SQL-shaped keyword
pair within 300 characters or the string being passed directly to a real `execute()`/`executemany()`
call; fails open (keeps the finding) on anything it can't parse or recognize, so it never silently
hides a real vulnerability of a shape it wasn't built to catch. Independently re-verified before
merging, not just trusted: read the actual new function and its regex, confirmed the bounded
`.{0,300}?` replaced the unbounded original, confirmed it's wired into `check_bandit`'s filtering,
and confirmed the two Deterministic-Scan findings still showing on this PR's own diff
(`bandit_scanner.py`'s pre-existing `import subprocess` and `subprocess.run(cmd, ...)` call to
invoke the real `bandit` binary) are untouched-by-this-diff code, the same "whole file gets
rescanned" pattern already seen elsewhere, not new issues. One CI failure
(`pytest-macos (3.12)`, unrelated `test_aletheore_search_regex_mode`) confirmed flaky, not caused by
this change - the sibling `pytest-macos (3.14)` job in the same run passed, and the retry passed
clean. No migrations. All five app-relevant services rebuilt and force-recreated (`app-server`,
`scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, `scheduler` - the only file changed,
`src/aletheore/static_analysis/bandit_scanner.py`, is pip-installed by all five); confirmed healthy
via `docker compose ps` (`Up`, `healthy` within ~13s of recreation), zero errors in logs in the 30s
since restart, `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`, and
the fix confirmed present in the *running* `scan-worker` container's actual source via
`inspect.getsource(aletheore.static_analysis.bandit_scanner)` - not re-read from the repo:
`_sql_injection_is_plausible` present, the bounded `{0,300}` regex present, wired into `check_bandit`.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-28 (second deploy) - production was redeployed to
`master` (commit `e159e6b`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-28-2`) and re-verified live via SSH
the same session. 3 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-28`): #871
(a real thread-join race in `test_postgres_graph_store.py` that could leak a straggler thread's DB
write into a later test's already-truncated `installations` table - test-only, no runtime impact)
and #860 (this doc, no-op for running services) - only #861 had real runtime impact:
`/dashboard`'s repo picker empty state (no installation, or one still on the free plan) now shows
real "Install the Aletheore GitHub App" and "Subscribe to AIR" buttons instead of explanatory text
with nothing clickable. No migrations. `app-server` alone rebuilt and force-recreated (the only
image #861's `frontend.py` change touches; #871/#860 have no runtime code); confirmed healthy via
`docker compose ps` (`Up`, `healthy` within ~13s of recreation), zero errors in its logs in the 30s
since restart, `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`,
and the fix confirmed present in the *running* container's actual source via
`inspect.getsource(app_server.frontend)` - not re-read from the repo: both CTA strings present, the
install URL wrapped in `escape()`, and `_picker_html` carrying a real `lru_cache`.

**Correction to the entry directly below:** its tag `github-app-deploy-2026-09-28` was originally
created pointing at `06a7eb6` (#858 merged, before #857 had) instead of the commit actually
fast-forwarded to and built on the server (`5385ea8`, which includes #857) - caught while scoping
this second deploy's own diff (scan_worker files spuriously appeared as "changed since last
deploy" until this was found and fixed). The tag has been deleted and recreated at the correct
`5385ea8`; the prose below was already accurate, only the git tag object was wrong.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-28 (first deploy) - production was redeployed to `master` (commit
`5385ea8`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-28`) and re-verified live via SSH the same session. 45
commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-26-2`), no migrations. Two real
fixes of note, both independently re-verified before this deploy, not just trusted at merge time:

- **#858 (P0 security fix)**: a live-reported cross-account access bug - a user with no real access
  to the founder's private repos, qualified only via GitHub's coarse `/user/installations` set (read
  access to a single repo an installation covers, including a public one, is enough), saw the
  founder's private repo list on `/app/repos` and the founder's account as their own checkout target
  on `/subscribe`. Traced to root cause via direct code reading, not guessed: the coarse set was
  trusted directly by 6 endpoints (confirmed live against two real accounts), plus 4 more found
  auditing every other call site of the same pattern - the worst being `/v1/cli-tokens`, which could
  mint a real, usable API credential against someone else's installation, and
  `/admin/{org}/{repo}/delete-all-data`, real full data erasure. Fixed with two shared helpers
  (`_is_real_installation_member_or_admin`, `_require_real_admin_or_member`) requiring either seated
  membership or real per-repo GitHub admin permission, verified against GitHub directly when
  Aletheore has no scan history yet. A same-PR follow-up closed one more gap the same audit style
  found: `_require_dashboard_installation` only ran its real check `if installation is not None`,
  silently succeeding on the coarse set alone otherwise (repo_history's `ON DELETE CASCADE` FK means
  a completed delete can't produce this state, but a delete racing the request could) - fixed to 404.
  Every fix has its own regression test (including a mutation test on the most severe one, and a
  concurrency test proving the parallelization fix is real, not just refactored); full suite green
  (2229 passed, 8 skipped) before merge.
- **#854**: `packet_cache`'s cache key collided across unrelated subsystems reading the same
  underlying evidence packet.
- **#857**: the PR evidence-diff comment gets a real per-file "what changed" section (blast-radius
  summary + a computed, not LLM-guessed, file-change list).
- Also included: Flash Review rank+severity surfaced on the PR comment (#843), the `aletheore mcp`
  background evidence watcher (#841), Python 3.13/3.14 support (#840), and the routine
  release/site-data bumps in between (#838-842).
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt and force-recreated (`app-server` for the security fix;
  `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, `scheduler` share the `scan-worker` image, which
  changed for `packet_cache.py` and the `pr_comment`/`jobs.py` changes) - `jina-embed` left untouched
  (no lockfile change).
- Services running: all five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~52 seconds
  of recreation. Zero errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in any of the five rebuilt services' logs in
  the 10 minutes since restart (grepped, not eyeballed).
- No pending migrations - confirmed via `git diff --stat` against the previous deploy tag showing no
  new files under `github-app/migrations/`.
- Post-deploy, verified live by executing directly inside the running containers, not by re-reading
  the repo: inside `app-server` - `inspect.getsource(app_server.admin)` contains
  `_verify_installation_ids` and the single-page (`per_page": 1`) fix to
  `_fetch_any_covered_repo_sync`; `inspect.getsource(app_server.dashboard)` contains the
  `if installation is None:` / `"no such repo"` fail-closed fix. Inside `scan-worker` -
  `inspect.getsource(scan_worker.packet_cache)` references subsystem-scoping; `aletheore.pr_comment`
  contains the new overview/file-changes content.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- Deploy required an admin override past a repo-wide GitHub ruleset (`code_quality`, zero open
  error-severity code-scanning alerts) blocking all merges to `master` - unrelated to this PR, driven
  by long-standing Scorecard findings and two pre-existing CodeQL alerts neither #858 nor #857
  touches. Worth a real look separately; not addressed in this deploy.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10 (restore drill itself
  upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-26 - production was redeployed to `master` (commit
`3c09867`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-26`) and re-verified live via SSH the same session. Only
PR #828 since the previous tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-25-7`), no migrations. `app-server`,
`scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker` and `scheduler` rebuilt and force-recreated
(`jina-embed` untouched); all `healthy`, zero errors in the logs after restart, `/healthz` and the
public status API returning 200, and `reservation_state` (the Flash Review double-release fix)
confirmed present by grepping `scan_worker/jobs.py` inside the running `scan-worker` container.
Credit accounting was checked against the ledger after the deploy: the Aletheore install's balance
drop (about $0.06 since it was restored to $18.00) matched its `llm_spend_events`, and the other
paid install was unchanged. Six earlier deploys on 2026-09-25 (tags `-2` to `-7`: dashboard
restructure, sidebar scroll, real logo and favicon, sign-in, and the credit leak fix) are written up
in `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`; the evidence schema moved to 0.7.0 in `-3`.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-25 (first deploy) - production was redeployed to `master` (commit
`1d4da1f`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-25`) and re-verified live via SSH the same session.
69 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-23-5`), 1 migration (069,
`flash_review_history`, confirmed applied) - see `github-app/CHANGELOG.md` for the full writeup.
`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, and `scheduler` rebuilt and
force-recreated (`jina-embed` untouched); all `healthy`, zero errors in any of the five services'
logs since restart, `/healthz` and the public status API returning 200. Fixes confirmed present in
the *running* containers' source by grepping the files inside them (not re-read from the repo):
`_recent_failed_job_count` and `insert_review_history` in `scan_worker/jobs.py`, `ON CONFLICT DO
NOTHING` in `scan_worker/code_graph_store.py`, `ClientDisconnect` in `app_server/main.py`,
`WEBHOOK_5XX_WINDOW_SECONDS = 300` in `app_server/redis_client.py`, and the new
`blast_radius_summary.py`. The new failed-jobs alert logic was confirmed live: `ops_monitor` ran
three times after the restart and left no `failed_jobs` first-seen key in Redis, so the 26 old
failed scans no longer count. The 26 old failed-job records were exported to a local backup and are
still in the registry (their removal was not run).

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-23 (third deploy) - production was redeployed to
`master` (commit `1618369`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-23-3`) and re-verified live via SSH
the same session. 3 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-23-2`), no
migrations - see `github-app/CHANGELOG.md` for the full writeup. Two real production bugs, both
found live investigating this session's own earlier deploy, plus one docs-only PR:
`_post_flash_review_finding_comments` (#775) reported `len(findings_to_post)` in its summary
comment - what was *attempted* - instead of what actually landed, overclaiming when GitHub's
diff-position validation 422s a citation (caught live on PR #764: summary said 4 posted, only 3
inline comments existed); and the shallow `git fetch --depth 1` this session's earlier deploy
(`github-app-deploy-2026-09-23-2`) introduced for ephemeral checkouts (#774) turned out to be
unsafe for every one of its callers (#776) - `_run_scan` always walks full git history
(`find_secrets_in_history`, `analyze_git`), so a depth-1 base-commit checkout silently collapsed
that history to one commit, making the PR-scan evidence-diff comment report the checkout's entire
real history as newly introduced (caught live on PR #775: reported 1241 commits' worth of secrets
as new). Fixed by fetching each ref's full ancestry instead - still a smaller transfer than the
original `git clone --no-checkout` (which pulled every branch and tag), just not shallow.
`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, and `scheduler` all rebuilt and
force-recreated (both fixes touch `scan_worker/jobs.py`, shared by all five); confirmed healthy
via `docker compose ps` (all `healthy`), zero errors in any of the five services' logs since
restart, and both fixes confirmed present in the *running* `scan-worker` container's actual source
via `inspect.getsource` and direct inspection of the real `git fetch` subprocess call arguments
(no `--depth` flag; the string appears only in the function's own docstring explaining the bug it
replaced) - not re-read from the repo, and not fooled by a naive substring match against the
docstring.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-21 - production was redeployed to `master` (commit
`d832130`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-21`) and re-verified live via SSH the same session.
2 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-19-2`), no migrations - see
`github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s "2026-09-21" entry for the full writeup. One real production
incident, caught live (an alert email roughly every 3 minutes for 12+ hours) and fixed the same
session: `error_alerts.py`'s alert-cooldown was a process-local dict that never actually survived
`scan_worker.worker`'s fork-per-job RQ `Worker`, so `run_health_sweep_staleness_check_job` (and
any other direct `send_error_alert` caller) re-alerted on every ~180s tick instead of respecting
its intended 6-hour cooldown - moved to a Redis key with a TTL, atomic across every forked job
process and both `scan-worker` replicas. `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
`health-worker`, and `scheduler` all rebuilt and force-recreated (the fix touches
`app_server/error_alerts.py` and `app_server/main.py`, both imported by every one of them);
confirmed healthy via `docker compose ps` (all `healthy`), zero errors in any of the five
services' logs since restart, and the fix confirmed present in the *running* `scan-worker`
container's actual source via `inspect.getsource` (asserted `_ALERT_COOLDOWN_KEY_PREFIX` and
`get_redis_client` present, `_last_alert_at` gone) - not re-read from the repo.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-13 (second deploy) - production was redeployed to
`master` (commit `47ee0ab`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-13-2`) and re-verified live via SSH
the same session. 6 commits since the first 2026-09-13 deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-13`),
no migrations - see `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s "2026-09-13 (second deploy)" entry for the full
writeup. Two substantive changes: Flash Review suggestions now render as real, one-click GitHub
"Suggested change" blocks (#707) behind a mechanical safety gate (exact single-line match,
deterministic re-indentation, no-op/similarity rejection, tree-sitter parse confirmation) plus a
second, adversarially-framed `deepseek-v4-flash` call judging the suggestion's semantic
correctness before it's ever rendered clickable - runs on Flash and AIR, explicitly excluded for
free tier via a new `verify_suggestions` flag to avoid silently breaking an existing "never called
for free tier" cost-accounting assumption; the aletheore MCP server's instructions now ask
connecting agents to file a GitHub issue on a genuine tool-side gap instead of silently working
around it (#708). All six services rebuilt and force-recreated; confirmed healthy via
`docker compose ps` (all `healthy`) and `no pending migrations`/zero errors in `app-server`'s logs
since restart, and both fixes confirmed present in the *running* containers' actual source via
`inspect.getsource` - not re-read from the repo: `scan-worker` shows
`SUGGESTION_CORRECTNESS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and a `verify_suggestions` parameter on `review_diff`;
`app-server` shows the real `github.com/Aletheore/Aletheore/issues` URL in `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS`.
The website's own copy fix (#706) deploys independently via Vercel and was separately confirmed
live at `www.aletheore.com` - not part of this docker stack.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-13 (first deploy) - production was redeployed to `master`
(commit `4a5d808`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-13`) and re-verified live via SSH the same
session. 8 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-11`), no migrations -
see `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s 2026-09-13 entry for the full per-fix writeup covering PRs 688,
689, 690, 692, 695, 700, 701, and 702. Highlights: a real cross-scan-worker-replica race in the
git graph store closed with a Postgres advisory lock (#690); a GitHub OAuth quirk (200 status with
an error body) that surfaced as an unhandled 500 on code exchange, mirroring a fix the
refresh-token path already had (#692); the entire unused GitHub Marketplace webhook path removed
after confirming live on GitHub that no listing has ever existed for this App (#702). All six
services rebuilt and force-recreated (`app-server`; the shared `scan-worker` image backing
`scan-worker`/`scan-worker-2`/`health-worker`/`scheduler`; `jina-embed`); confirmed healthy via
`docker ps` and `/healthz` (both the container-internal check and the public
`app.aletheore.com` endpoint), zero errors in `app-server`'s logs since restart, and each of the
eight fixes confirmed present in the running containers' actual source via `inspect.getsource` -
not re-read from the repo - checking a marker specific to each (see the CHANGELOG entry for the
exact list).

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-11 - production was redeployed to `master` (commit `6451c41`,
tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-11`) and re-verified live via SSH the same session. 4 commits
since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-10-3`), all real credit/billing and
AIRview-caching bug fixes, no migrations: an out-of-order Paddle webhook could reset a newer
billing period's credit back to a stale allotment (#656); Flash Review's own true-up path never
drained the balance to zero on an insufficient-overage reservation failure (#657); cancelling an
annual AIR subscription never disarmed its synthetic monthly credit-reset clock, so a cancelled
installation could still get a free monthly top-up (#658); AIRview's single-target write path
never cached its own output, so the wiki page it had just built was recomputed on the very next
request that should have hit cache (#659). Both Docker images changed (`app-server` for #656/#658,
the shared `scan-worker` image for #657/#659, which also backs `scan-worker-2`/`health-worker`/
`scheduler`), so all five services were rebuilt and force-recreated; confirmed healthy, all four
fixes present in the running containers' actual source (`inspect.getsource` checked for markers
specific to each fix - "out-of-order"/"stale"/"disarm" in `app_server.db`, "overage" in
`scan_worker.jobs` - not re-read from the repo), zero errors in logs, the pre-existing scheduled
jobs (`run_monthly_credit_reset_sweep_job`, `run_ops_monitor_job`) still running cleanly on the
recreated `scan-worker`.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-10 (third deploy) - production's `app-server` was redeployed
to `master` (commit `428e8fd`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-10-3`) and re-verified live via
SSH the same session. Single-file fix (#654): PR #651's `align-items: start` fix for the
settings-page column gap was a visual no-op (that property only repositions a shorter item within
an already-tall grid row, it doesn't shrink the row) - the real fix moves "Managed audit content"
into the left column instead of the right, the best 2-way height partition of the five settings
cards, cutting the empty gap from ~400px to ~50px. `app-server` alone rebuilt and force-recreated;
confirmed healthy, the fix present in the running container's actual source (`inspect.getsource`
checked for the "Managed audit content sits in the LEFT column deliberately" comment, not re-read
from the repo), zero errors in logs. The rest of this section (all five services, the migrations,
the credit-balance schema) is unaffected and still accurate for everything except the `app-server`
commit, which is now `428e8fd`.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-10 (first deploy) - production was redeployed to `master`
(commit `ee927c8`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-10`) and re-verified live via SSH the same
session. 25 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-08-2`): the
dollar-credit pricing launch (real per-installation LLM-spend balance replacing the flat cap, live
Paddle top-up purchases, a new scheduled monthly-credit-reset job for annual AIR subscribers), a
Flash Review prompt-caching fix, and an independent 10-PR hardening/feature batch. Full detail in
`github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s own 2026-09-10 entry - this section is the live-verification record,
not a duplicate of the changelog.

**Previous:** CURRENT as of 2026-09-08 (second deploy) - production was redeployed to `master` (commit `a6e2457`, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-08-2`) and re-verified live via SSH the same day. 14 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-08`): a second, independent 10-PR hardening pass (a fresh adversarial audit round, disjoint from the first) plus one product removal. Real fixes in the audit batch: a Rails `reversible do |dir|` block's `dir.down` was read as forward-migration code (#593); Go/Rust/Java/C# compiled-language entry points always looked unreachable to dead-code detection (#594); the secret scanner missed `SECRET_KEY`/`*_TOKEN` assignments entirely (#595); a Flash Review hunk-scope correction fired a self-contradictory false positive on every Python class-header hunk (#596); Gin route groups silently dropped their `.Group()` prefix (#597); the repo's own license went undetected for Rust/PHP/Ruby/C#/Java (#598); a Maven `pom.xml` with no declared `xmlns` was invisible to vulnerability scanning (#599); JVM co-located test files (`FooTest.kt` beside `Foo.kt`) were invisible to test-path detection (#600); evidence resolution misattributed commits by whole-file recency and dropped risk findings on a package-name mismatch (#601); `aletheore_ast_pattern` ignored `.aletheore.json` exclusions and `mcp-install` could follow a symlink out of the repo (#603); a nested/nonstandard build-tool Dockerfile and Symfony's `.env.dist` convention were both invisible to detection (#602). Every one of these 10 PRs was independently reviewed before merge, not rubber-stamped: Flash Review's own inline findings were checked against the real diff, and 5 held up as genuine bugs the fix PRs hadn't fully closed - all fixed before merging, not shipped: the `dir.down` exclusion matched any receiver's `.down()` call, not just a real `reversible` block's (#593); three compiled-language entry-point regexes were simultaneously too loose (Rust matched a nested `fn main` inside `mod tests`) and too strict (Java's modifier order, C#'s cross-line static+Main) (#594); a gemspec license regex matched commented-out assignments (#598); Maven namespace-stripping removed every `{uri}` prefix, not just Maven's own, so a foreign-namespaced plugin config block could be parsed as real dependency metadata (#599); the Gin group-prefix binding table was keyed file-wide instead of per function scope, so two functions reusing the idiomatic "v1" group-variable name bled into each other's routes (#597). One finding (a claimed git-blame `^` boundary-commit marker in `--porcelain` output, #601) was checked against real git 2.52.0 behavior across both documented trigger cases and did not reproduce - dismissed with the evidence rather than fixed blind. **Product removal, with a real migration**: the public, unauthenticated "paste a repo" website demo was removed entirely (#605) - its own RQ worker, Docker-socket-holding sidecar, three Dockerfiles, docker-compose services, and website form, on the reasoning that the free CLI already covers what it offered and it was the only unauthenticated internet-facing attack surface in the system (this session's own audit had just found a real crash bug in it, #604, closed as superseded by the removal). Migration `061_drop_demo_scan_rate_limits.sql` drops the now-orphaned table (no FK references it, IP+timestamp rate-limit state only). Independently re-verified before merging, not just trusted: repo-wide grep for zero remaining references, the migration's safety, the CORS-narrowing change against `website/status.js`'s real cross-origin call, and both test suites run locally (1779/1779 `src`, 1742 passed + 8 skipped `github-app`, matching the PR's own claims exactly) - one real gap found and fixed before merge: the root `README.md`'s repository-layout line still described `website/` as carrying "the marketing site and live demo", missed by a literal demo-scan/demo-sandbox string search since it names neither.

## Purpose

This runbook prevents repository state from being confused with production state.

## Required Checks

Before claiming a hardening change is live, verify:

- The server checkout path and remote.
- The deployed branch and commit.
- The working tree status.
- Running Compose services.
- Container startup commands.
- App server, worker, scheduler, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Caddy health.
- Absence of Docker socket mounts.
- Non-root app and worker users.
- CPU and memory limits for app server and scan worker.
- Migration runner execution before app startup.
- Backup script availability.
- Restore drill target database availability.

## Deploy Recipe

The production host's address and login are deliberately not recorded in this public repo; the operator keeps them outside it, and example SSH commands in older docs use `$PROD_SSH` for them.

Repo on the host: `/root/aletheore` (compose file in `github-app/`). `scan-worker` and
`scan-worker-2` are two separate Compose services, each with its own image name, not one service
scaled to two replicas. Roll them as separate services:

```bash
cd /root/aletheore && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/master && cd github-app
docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler
docker compose up -d --no-deps app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler
```

Do not pass `--scale scan-worker=2`. The 2026-08-22 to 2026-08-24 snapshots below used it, and on
2026-10-01 it created a third worker (`github-app-scan-worker-2`, a second replica of the
`scan-worker` service) while the real `scan-worker-2` service kept running on its old image, so
jobs could still be picked up by pre-deploy code. Building only `scan-worker` does not rebuild
`scan-worker-2`: they have separate image tags even though they share a Dockerfile, so the
second build is a fast cache hit but still has to be run. After any deploy, `docker ps` should
list exactly `github-app-scan-worker-1` and `github-app-scan-worker-2-1`, both `healthy` and both
recently started.

## Current Server Snapshot

As of 2026-10-02, following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch`, `git reset --hard origin/master`,
`docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler`, then
`docker compose up -d --no-deps` for the same five services, no `--scale`), the operator read back:

- Host: the production host, path `/root/aletheore`.
- Commit: `efa1f0e` (#898), which includes #892 to #897. No migrations.
- `docker ps`: `github-app-app-server-1`, `github-app-health-worker-1`, `github-app-scan-worker-1`,
  `github-app-scan-worker-2-1` and `github-app-scheduler-1` all `healthy` and 28 seconds old;
  `autoheal`, `caddy`, `jina-embed`, `postgres` and `redis` untouched. Exactly one replica of each
  scan worker, as the recipe requires.
- Verified live: inside `github-app-app-server-1`, `CREDIT_TOPUP_PRICE_ID` is
  `pri_01m3xpabknvke00n5vsxn4wpe0` and `resolve_plan_for_price_id("pri_01m3xpabbam5t2gkzwzmg0y9eq")`
  returns `flash`, so the new prices are in the running code; `https://app.aletheore.com/healthz`
  returned `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- Not verified this pass: container logs, the `app-server` startup line, and every Required Checks
  item that no change in this deploy touches.
- Paddle: the old $8 Flash price (`pri_01m1dj0m1netz6ze1mmckz73nm`, zero subscribers in any state)
  and the old $1.00 top-up price (`pri_01m23jw9qbsnm4zmv28bfebx4t`) are archived after this deploy
  (read back from Paddle: both `archived`, the two new prices `active`). Only abandoned draft
  checkouts from 2026-09-10 to 2026-09-27 referenced them.
- Open follow-up: run a real $5 top-up and refund end to end, which has never been done with real
  money.

## 2026-10-01 Snapshot


As of 2026-10-01, following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch`, then `git reset --hard
origin/master`, then `docker compose build app-server scan-worker health-worker scheduler`, then
`docker compose up -d --no-deps --scale scan-worker=2` for those four, then a corrective
`docker compose build scan-worker-2` and `docker compose up -d --no-deps --scale scan-worker=1
scan-worker scan-worker-2`), a partial inspection found (host-side output was read back from the operator rather than run
directly, and the pass covered less than the full Required Checks list; the gaps are the last
bullet):

- Host: the production host, path `/root/aletheore`.
- Commit: `72ece8d` (#890), which includes #889. No migrations in either PR.
- Changes live: the deterministic-scan hardening (#889: a scanner that silently failed or was
  skipped now reports a neutral check instead of a false green, the new/resolved split follows
  file renames, PMD's `CloseResource` rule is no longer blanket-silenced, `.repowise` is excluded,
  and subprocess calls to `git` and the `aletheore` CLI resolve their full path first) and the
  static-analysis dismissal wiring plus content-fingerprint identity (#890: a dismissed finding no
  longer fails the check, and a finding whose line shifted is no longer reported as both new and
  resolved).
- First pass used the stale `--scale scan-worker=2` form: `scan-worker` and `scan-worker-2` ended up
  as three containers, one of them (`github-app-scan-worker-2-1`) still on the old image. The
  corrective command above rebuilt and recreated `scan-worker-2` and removed the extra replica.
  Final `docker ps`: `github-app-scan-worker-1` and `github-app-scan-worker-2-1`, both `healthy`,
  alongside `app-server`, `health-worker`, `scheduler` (all `healthy`), plus the untouched
  `jina-embed`, `postgres`, `redis`, `caddy`, `autoheal`.
- Verified live: `grep -c "_git_path" /app/scan_worker/jobs.py` inside `github-app-scan-worker-1`
  returned 20 (the new code, not just the repo checkout); `docker logs --since 10m` on the same
  container matched zero lines for `error|traceback`; the public `https://app.aletheore.com/healthz`
  returned `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- Not re-verified this pass: working tree status, the `app-server` startup/migration log line, the
  other containers' logs, and every item under Required Checks that no change in this deploy
  touches (Docker socket mount absence, non-root users, CPU/memory limits, backup cron, base image
  digest pinning, restore drill, disk space). `scan-worker-2-1` was not grep-checked for
  `_git_path` directly; its image was built from the same cached layers as `scan-worker-1`'s.

## 2026-09-11 Snapshot

As of 2026-09-11, following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only
origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker
scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five - both images that
changed, plus the three services that share the `scan-worker` image with the two that actually
changed - no migrations, no lockfile changes), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `6451c41` (tag `github-app-deploy-2026-09-11`).
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `backups/` directory.
- 4 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-10-3`), all real bug fixes,
  no migrations: an out-of-order Paddle webhook could reset a newer billing period's credit back
  to a stale allotment (#656, `app_server/db.py`); Flash Review's own true-up path never drained
  the balance to zero on an insufficient-overage reservation failure (#657, `scan_worker/jobs.py`);
  cancelling an annual AIR subscription never disarmed its synthetic monthly credit-reset clock, so
  a cancelled installation could still receive a free monthly top-up (#658, `app_server/db.py` +
  `app_server/webhooks/paddle.py`); AIRview's single-target write path never cached its own output,
  so the wiki page it had just built was recomputed on the very next request that should have hit
  cache (#659, `scan_worker/live_wiki.py`).
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt and force-recreated (`app-server`, `scan-worker`,
  `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, `scheduler`) - `app-server`'s own image changed (#656, #658)
  and the shared `scan-worker` image changed (#657, #659), which also backs `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, and `scheduler`.
- Services running: all five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~15
  seconds of recreation.
- No migrations to apply - confirmed via `ls github-app/migrations/` showing `065_...` as the
  newest file both before and after this deploy, matching the diff's own file list (no new
  `migrations/*.sql`).
- Post-deploy, verified live by executing directly inside the running containers, not by re-reading
  the repo: `inspect.getsource(app_server.db)` contains the "out-of-order"/"stale"/"disarm" markers
  specific to #656/#658, and `inspect.getsource(scan_worker.jobs)` contains the "overage" marker
  specific to #657 - all present, not assumed from source.
- `docker logs` on `app-server` and `scan-worker` show zero errors and the pre-existing scheduled
  jobs (`run_live_wiki_catchup_sweep_job`, `run_monthly_credit_reset_sweep_job`,
  `run_ops_monitor_job`) still completing cleanly on the recreated worker.

## 2026-09-10 (third deploy) Snapshot

**Superseded by two same-day follow-ups:** two further, smaller redeploys landed after the
snapshot below

- commit `f8b2f36` (tag `github-app-deploy-2026-09-10-2`), `app-server` only (single-file frontend
fix, #651 - settings-page CSS dead space and a stuck "Opening checkout..." status with no
`eventCallback`). Rebuilt and force-recreated `app-server` alone; confirmed healthy, both fixes
present in the running container's source (`inspect.getsource` checked for `align-items: start`
and `eventCallback`, not re-read from the repo), zero errors in logs.
- commit `428e8fd` (tag `github-app-deploy-2026-09-10-3`), `app-server` only (single-file frontend
fix, #654 - the `align-items: start` fix above turned out to be a visual no-op; the real fix moves
"Managed audit content" into the left settings column instead of the right, the best 2-way height
partition of the five cards). Rebuilt and force-recreated `app-server` alone; confirmed healthy,
the fix present in the running container's actual source, zero errors in logs.

The rest of this section (all five services, the migrations, the credit-balance schema) is
unaffected by either follow-up and still accurate for everything except the `app-server` commit,
which is now `428e8fd`.

As of 2026-09-10 (first deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only
origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker
scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five - the usual five, no
lockfile changes in this batch), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `ee927c8`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `backups/` directory.
- 25 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-08-2`) - see
  `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s 2026-09-10 entry for the full breakdown (dollar-credit pricing launch,
  LLM cost cleanup, and an independent 10-PR hardening batch).
- **Real migrations this deploy, all four confirmed applied live, not just "no pending" logged**:
  `SELECT filename FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY filename DESC LIMIT 6` shows `065_annual_air_
  monthly_credit_reset.sql`, `064_base_credit_allotment.sql`, `063_installation_credit_balance.sql`,
  and `062_llm_spend_events.sql` as the four newest rows. Confirmed live in the running
  `installations` table via `\d installations`: `base_credit_remaining_usd`, `topup_credit_balance_
  usd`, `base_credit_allotment_usd`, and `next_monthly_credit_reset_at` all present with the
  expected types/defaults, and the new partial index (`installations_next_monthly_credit_reset_at`,
  `WHERE next_monthly_credit_reset_at IS NOT NULL`) exists via `\di`.
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt and recreated (`app-server`, `scan-worker`,
  `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, `scheduler`) - `jina-embed` left untouched (no lockfile change).
- Services running: all five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~26
  seconds of recreation.
- **New scheduled job confirmed running, not just registered in code**: `run_monthly_credit_reset_
  sweep_job` (added to `scheduler.py`'s existing `run_forever` tick) completed successfully on its
  first tick post-deploy - `rq.worker` log shows it picked up, executed, and completed in ~10ms
  (currently a no-op sweep, zero real annual-AIR subscribers exist yet).
- Real Paddle top-up price confirmed live inside the running container, not re-read from source:
  `python -c "from app_server.paddle_pricing import CREDIT_TOPUP_PRICE_ID; print(...)"` returns
  `pri_01m23jw9qbsnm4zmv28bfebx4t`, matching the real price created via the Paddle MCP.
- Real credit-allotment math confirmed live: `base_credit_for_plan('flash', 0)` returns `5.0`,
  `base_credit_for_plan('air', 2)` returns `24.0` ($18 + $3 x 2 extra seats).
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok",
  "redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in any of the five rebuilt services' logs after restart
  (checked the full window since recreation, not a narrow grep).
- Not re-verified this pass (out of scope, no relevant Dockerfile/host changes in this batch):
  Docker socket mount absence, non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image
  digest pinning, restore-drill target availability, disk space. Each was last directly verified in
  the 2026-08-10 deploy (restore drill itself upgraded 2026-08-24) - re-check if any host-level or
  Dockerfile change touches them.

## 2026-09-08 (second deploy) Snapshot

As of 2026-09-08 (second deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five - the usual five; the only lockfile change in this batch was `requirements-demo-scan-worker.lock.txt` itself being deleted, so nothing else needed rebuilding), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `a6e2457`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 14 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-08`) - see Snapshot
  Freshness above for the second hardening batch, the 5 real findings caught before merge, and
  the demo-scan removal. Full per-PR writeups in `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Real migration this deploy**: `git diff --stat` against the previous deploy tag showed one
  new file under `github-app/migrations/` (`061_drop_demo_scan_rate_limits.sql`, a `DROP TABLE
  IF EXISTS`) - confirmed no FK referenced the table before dropping, not assumed.
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt (`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, `scheduler`) - `jina-embed` left untouched (no lockfile change);
  `demo-scan-worker`/`demo-sandbox`/`demo-sandbox-runner` no longer exist as of this deploy
  (removed by #605, not merely left unrebuilt).
- Services running: all five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~16
  seconds of recreation.
- Migration applied, not just "no pending" - confirmed live in Postgres, not just a log line:
  `SELECT filename FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY filename DESC LIMIT 3` shows
  `061_drop_demo_scan_rate_limits.sql` as the newest row, and `\dt demo_scan_rate_limits`
  reports the table no longer exists.
- Post-deploy, verified live by executing directly inside the running `app-server` container,
  not by re-reading the repo: `import app_server.demo_scan_api` raises `ModuleNotFoundError` -
  the module is genuinely gone from the running image, not just absent from source.
- The removed public attack surface is closed live, not just in code: `POST
  https://app.aletheore.com/v1/demo-scan` returned `202 Accepted` (queued, but orphaned - no
  worker left to consume it) immediately after the container teardown but *before* this
  redeploy, and returns `404` after it, confirmed by two real requests against the live
  endpoint, not assumed from the diff.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200
  {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in any of the five rebuilt services' logs after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (out of scope, no relevant Dockerfile/host changes in the diff other
  than the three deleted demo-* Dockerfiles): Docker socket mount absence, non-root users,
  CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill target
  availability, disk space. Each was last directly verified in the 2026-08-10 deploy (restore
  drill itself upgraded 2026-08-24) - re-check if any host-level or Dockerfile change touches
  them.

## 2026-09-08 (first deploy) Snapshot

As of 2026-09-08 (first deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five - back to the usual five, no lockfile changes in this batch so `jina-embed`/`demo-scan-worker` didn't need rebuilding), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `fd7c2c3`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 12 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-07`) - see Snapshot
  Freshness above for the two regressions caught and fixed before merge, the real spend-leak
  fix (#583), and the rest of the batch. Full per-PR writeups in `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Real migration this deploy** (unlike every deploy since 2026-09-06): `git diff --stat`
  against the previous deploy tag showed one new file under `github-app/migrations/`
  (`060_endpoint_health_selection.sql`, a new table) - confirmed idempotent
  (`CREATE TABLE`/`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`) before deploying, not assumed.
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt (`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, `scheduler`) - `jina-embed`/`demo-scan-worker`/`demo-sandbox-runner` left
  untouched (no lockfile changes in this batch).
- Services running: all five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~25
  seconds of recreation.
- Migration applied, not just "no pending" - `app-server`'s startup log shows
  `applied 1 migration(s)`. Confirmed live in Postgres, not just the log line: `\d
  endpoint_health_selection` shows the real schema (FK to `installations` with `ON DELETE
  CASCADE`, the unique constraint, the lookup index) exactly matching the migration file.
- Post-deploy, verified live by executing directly inside the running `scan-worker` container,
  not by re-reading the repo: `scan_worker.jobs.rank_endpoints_by_selection` returns scan order
  with no selection and the filtered/sorted set with one - the real ranking logic both the sweep
  and the admin dashboard route share; `MAX_HEALTH_CHECK_ENDPOINTS_PER_TARGET` reads `64`;
  `scan_worker.airview_scanner_context.MAX_SCHEMA_TABLES`/`MAX_ENDPOINTS` both read `50`;
  `aletheore.model_associations._class_nodes` and `app_server.admin._monitored_endpoint_keys`
  both import and call cleanly.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in any of the five rebuilt services' logs in the 60 seconds
  after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (out of scope, no relevant Dockerfile/host changes in the diff): Docker
  socket mount absence, non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest
  pinning, restore-drill target availability, disk space. Each was last directly verified in the
  2026-08-10 deploy (restore drill itself upgraded 2026-08-24) - re-check if any host-level or
  Dockerfile change touches them.

## 2026-09-07 Snapshot

As of 2026-09-07, following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler jina-embed demo-scan-worker` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those seven - two more than every prior deploy's usual five, since `jina-embed` and `demo-scan-worker` each pin `anyio` directly in their own lockfiles and #577's bump touched both), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `ce5ab60`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 18 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-06`) - see Snapshot
  Freshness above for the two real fixes (installation-token retry, Slack/Teams hostname
  detection) and the rest of the batch. Full per-PR writeups in `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Confirmed before deploying, not assumed: `git diff --stat` against the previous deploy tag showed
  no files under `github-app/migrations/` - a code-only deploy.
- All seven affected services rebuilt (`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, `scheduler`, `jina-embed`, `demo-scan-worker`) - `demo-sandbox-runner` left
  untouched (its Dockerfile doesn't install from any of the changed lockfiles).
- Services running: all seven `Up`, six reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~46 seconds of
  recreation (`demo-scan-worker` has no healthcheck defined, consistent with every prior deploy).
- No pending migrations - `app-server`'s startup log shows `no pending migrations`.
- Post-deploy, verified live by executing directly inside the running containers, not by re-reading
  the repo: inside `scan-worker` - `app_server.github_auth.INSTALLATION_TOKEN_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`
  reads `1.0`; `scan_worker.slack._detect_platform("https://notoffice.com.evil.example/webhook")`
  correctly returns `"slack"` (the lookalike-domain fix); `app_server.llm_cost.PLAN_CAP_OVERRIDE_USD`
  reads `{'flash': 6.0, 'air': 20.0}`; `scan_worker.github_api.MAX_CONTEXT_FILE_BYTES` reads
  `100000`; `scan_worker.jobs.MAX_WIKI_FULL_BUILD_CLUSTERS`/`MAX_DOCS_FULL_BUILD_FILES` both read
  `200`; `scan_worker.jobs.WIKI_FULL_BUILD_LLM_RESERVE_USD` reads `0.1`. Package versions confirmed
  via `pip show` inside `app-server`: `psycopg` 3.3.5, `pydantic` 2.13.5, `pydantic-core` 2.46.5,
  `rq` 2.12.0, `anyio` 4.15.0 - and inside `jina-embed`: `anyio` 4.15.0.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in any of the seven rebuilt services' logs in the 60 seconds
  after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (out of scope, no relevant Dockerfile/host changes in the diff beyond
  the lockfile bumps already covered above): Docker socket mount absence, non-root users, CPU/mem
  limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill target availability, disk
  space. Each was last directly verified in the 2026-08-10 deploy (restore drill itself upgraded
  2026-08-24) - re-check if any host-level or Dockerfile change touches them.

## 2026-09-06 Snapshot

As of 2026-09-06, following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five - same five as every prior deploy; this batch touched both `github-app/app_server`/`github-app/scan_worker` directly and `src/aletheore/*`, which all five images `pip install` as a package), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `cf8d40f`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 19 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-04`) - see Snapshot
  Freshness above for the two headline workstreams (schema/ORM-migration pipeline feeding Flash
  Review and AIRview/Docs; Rails model-association clustering fix) and the smaller fixes bundled
  alongside them. Full per-PR writeups in `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Confirmed before deploying, not assumed: `git diff --stat` against the previous deploy tag showed
  no files under `github-app/migrations/` - a code-only deploy despite 149 files and ~8,900
  insertions changed overall.
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt (`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, `scheduler`) - `jina-embed` left untouched (its Dockerfile never copies
  `src/aletheore`), `demo-scan-worker`/`demo-sandbox-runner` also untouched.
- Services running: all five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~20
  seconds of recreation (no in-flight job held up the recreate).
- No pending migrations - `app-server`'s startup log shows `no pending migrations`.
- Post-deploy, verified live by executing directly inside the running containers, not by re-reading
  the repo: inside `scan-worker` - `aletheore.model_associations.rails_model_association_edges`
  imports cleanly; `aletheore.architecture.build_clusters`'s live signature includes the new
  `extra_edges` parameter; `aletheore.orm_migrations._pluralize` imports cleanly;
  `aletheore.docs_reference._code_span` produces a correctly-widened fence for a value containing a
  literal backtick (the #551 fix); `scan_worker.flash_review_hunk_scope`,
  `scan_worker.flash_review_schema_context`, and `scan_worker.airview_scanner_context` all import
  cleanly. Inside `app-server` - `app_server.dashboard`, `scan_worker.github_api`,
  `aletheore.schema_map.extract_schema`, and `aletheore.scope_lookup` all import cleanly.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs in the 60 seconds after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10 (restore drill itself
  upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

## 2026-09-04 Snapshot

As of 2026-09-04, following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five - same five as every prior deploy, since none of this batch touched `github-app/app_server`/`github-app/scan_worker` directly, only `src/aletheore/*`, which all five images `pip install` as a package), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `8bf52ef`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 6 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-03`): #526 (this doc, no-op),
  #527 (six real secrets-scanner gaps in `_is_likely_placeholder` - private-key-header path
  suppression, generic-credential-assignment false-matching bare property references, missing
  truncation-marker/`"default"` placeholder recognition, PEM-boilerplate-without-a-key-body), #532
  (vulnerabilities pilot corpus completed for all 10 ecosystems - a clean pass, 10/10 recall, 0/7
  false positives, no code changes), #529 (the real `unused_dependencies` bug described above -
  see Snapshot Freshness for the root cause), #530 (docs-only - corrects `ast_pattern.py`'s and
  `pyproject.toml`'s false claim that the tree-sitter segfault is 3.14-only), #531 (three real
  license-detection gaps - BSD license bodies never contain the literal word "bsd" so
  `flask`/`gorilla-mux` came back "unknown" despite being unambiguously BSD-licensed, `LICENSE.rst`
  was missing from the checked filename list, Maven license lookup never followed `<parent>` POM
  references so `Guava`/`Protobuf-java` came back "unknown" via `gson`'s real `pom.xml`; also added
  CDDL to the weak-copyleft bucket).
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt (`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, `scheduler`) - `jina-embed` left untouched (its Dockerfile never copies
  `src/aletheore`), `demo-scan-worker`/`demo-sandbox-runner` also untouched.
- Services running: all five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~20
  seconds of recreation.
- No pending migrations - `app-server`'s startup log shows `no pending migrations` (none of this
  batch touched the DB schema).
- Post-deploy, verified live by executing directly inside the running `scan-worker` container, not
  by re-reading the repo: `from aletheore.dead_code import _raw_external_import_roots` imports
  cleanly (the new function #529 adds); `'cddl' in aletheore.licenses._WEAK_COPYLEFT_MARKERS` is
  `True`; `len(aletheore.secrets.KNOWN_VENDOR_EXAMPLE_VALUES) == 5` (the two new GitHub-token
  examples #527 adds, on top of the three pre-existing ones).
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs in the 60 seconds after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10 (restore drill itself
  upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

## 2026-09-03 Snapshot

As of 2026-09-03, following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only origin/master` - a plain `git reset --hard` was blocked by this session's own destructive-command guard, but the working tree was already confirmed clean so a fast-forward merge landed the identical result - + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `e655be2`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 13 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-26`): #513 (docs-only,
  no-op), #514 (release 0.9.11, bundling #499/#503/#504/#505/#508/#509/#510/#511 - already covered
  by earlier snapshots' own commit ranges), #515 (real token-based batching for hosted embedding
  indexing), #517 (`watch`'s incremental rebuild skips architecture analysis and hotspots - a
  deliberate perf trade-off, not a bug), #516 (local embedding now defaults to jina, matching the
  hosted model), #518 (carries the pre-existing architecture analysis forward during that same
  incremental rebuild, so #517's skip doesn't silently blank it out over time), #519/#520 (docs-only
  comment fixes), #521 (`aletheore_ast_pattern` now caps results and doesn't crash on an unreadable
  file), #522 (real correctness bug: unlike #517's deliberate skip, `watch`'s incremental rebuild
  path was discarding real security findings too - fixed), #523 (docs-only), #524 (asyncpg pool
  size), #525 (LLM prompt-cache hit-rate visibility). See each PR for its own full writeup;
  `github-app/CHANGELOG.md` for the running log.
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt (`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, `scheduler` - `src/aletheore` changed extensively across this range, and all five
  copy it into their image) - `jina-embed` left untouched (its Dockerfile never copies
  `src/aletheore`; it's self-contained with its own baked-in model weights, so the new
  `src/aletheore/data/jina_v2_base_code_tokenizer.json` file added in this range doesn't affect it),
  `demo-scan-worker`/`demo-sandbox-runner` also untouched since neither's own source changed.
- Services running: all five `Up`, all five reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within ~30
  seconds of recreation.
- No pending migrations - `app-server`'s startup log shows `no pending migrations` (none of this
  range's changes touched the DB schema).
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded) by executing directly inside the
  running containers, not by re-reading the repo: `inspect.getsource` on `app_server.db.create_pool`
  confirms `min_size=5, max_size=20`; `inspect.getsource` on
  `scan_worker.jobs._IncrementalSpendBudget.record_usage` confirms the new cache-hit logging line.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`;
  real production request traffic (dashboard, audit endpoints) flowing normally in the access log
  immediately after restart.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs in the 60 seconds after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10 (restore drill itself
  upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

## 2026-08-27 (fifth deploy) Snapshot

As of 2026-08-27 (fifth deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `17ffd99`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 2 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-27-4`): a docs-only deploy
  record (#436, no-op for running services) and #437 - a second Claude session (`veridion-68`)
  found `handle_installation_event` had no branch at all for `installation_repositories`/`removed`
  (deselecting one repo from the GitHub App's repo list without uninstalling the whole app): the
  repo's dashboard entry, scan history, and every scheduled/webhook-triggered work path stayed live
  indefinitely, with no purge path anywhere in the codebase. Flagged as a real design decision
  (hard-purge vs. soft-hide) rather than patched unilaterally; Arihant's call was soft-hide -
  reversible, but a hidden repo must actually stop being processed, not just disappear from the
  dashboard, since a hidden-but-still-scanning repo keeps burning real LLM spend. New `hidden_repos`
  table (migration 057); `hide_repo`/`unhide_repo`/`is_repo_hidden` in `app_server/db.py`; gates
  `list_repos_for_installations` (dashboard), the PR/push/`/aletheore audit` webhook paths
  (`pull_request.py`, `push.py`, `issue_comment.py` - push specifically skips its compare-API call
  too, since access is already revoked), and all three scheduled sweeps that generate new per-repo
  work (health-check, docs catch-up, wiki catch-up, via a `hidden_repos` join in `scan_worker/db.py`);
  reversed by `installation_repositories/added`. Independently re-reviewed line-by-line before
  merge (not just the report taken at face value, per Arihant's explicit ask given this webhook
  surface had been stable) - cross-checked every scheduled sweep in `scan_worker/jobs.py` against
  its worklist function in `scan_worker/db.py` to confirm no sweep was missed, verified the
  `hide_repo` branch runs after `upsert_installation` so `hidden_repos`' FK is always satisfied
  regardless of webhook arrival order, and confirmed every changed test is additive (new hidden-repo
  cases or a mechanical `pool`-param thread-through) with no existing assertion changed. Full suite:
  1551 passed, 8 skipped, 0 failed. See `github-app/CHANGELOG.md` for the full writeup.
- All five app-relevant services rebuilt (`app-server` for the webhook gating in
  `app_server/webhooks/*.py`; `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, `scheduler` since
  all four run off the same image as `scan_worker/db.py`, which changed) - `demo-scan-worker` and
  `demo-sandbox-runner` left untouched since neither's own source changed.
- `scan-worker`/`scan-worker-2` have a deliberate 30m30s `stop_grace_period` (lets an in-flight scan
  job finish rather than killing it mid-run) and `health-worker` an 11m one - the recreate command
  waited on this rather than being force-killed early; this run's old containers had no in-flight
  job blocking it, so all five came up within seconds regardless.
- Services running: same set as the previous snapshot, all `Up`; all five rebuilt services
  reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within seconds of recreation.
- No pending migrations - `app-server`'s startup log shows `no pending migrations`; live-queried
  `information_schema.columns` for the new `hidden_repos` table and confirmed its three columns
  (`installation_id bigint`, `repo_full_name text`, `hidden_at timestamptz`) exist exactly as the
  migration defines them.
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded) by executing directly inside the
  running containers, not by re-reading the repo: `app_server.db.hide_repo`/`unhide_repo`/
  `is_repo_hidden` import cleanly; `inspect.getsource` on all four `app_server.webhooks.*` handlers
  confirms each contains the `is_repo_hidden`/`hide_repo` gating; `inspect.getsource` on all three
  `scan_worker.db` sweep-worklist functions confirms each joins `hidden_repos`.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs in the 3 minutes after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10 (restore drill itself
  upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

## 2026-08-27 (fourth deploy) Snapshot

As of 2026-08-27 (fourth deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate app-server`), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `084d5d2`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 3 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-27-3`): a version-number-only
  release bump (#432) and #435 itself - reduced Aletheore AIR's included seats from 5 to 3 and
  repriced the extra-seat add-on from $4.99 to $6.99/month (`db.py`'s `INCLUDED_SEATS`,
  `paddle_pricing.py`'s `EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_ID` swapped to a new Paddle price after confirming zero
  live subscribers on the old one, which was archived rather than mutated). A second Claude session
  (`veridion-68`) swept the branch for other places the price change could hit and found one real
  bug this PR's own diff had missed: `llm_cost.py`'s `EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_USD` was left at the old
  4.99 - a separate constant, not derived from `paddle_pricing.py`, rendered directly into two
  customer-facing surfaces (`frontend.py`'s "Buy extra seat" dashboard button and `admin.py`'s
  seat-cap-reached error message), which would have shown "$4.99/mo" while Paddle actually charged
  $6.99/mo on click - a real price-mismatch-at-checkout bug, fixed same-day in a follow-up commit
  (`a180c96`) before merge. See `github-app/CHANGELOG.md` for the full writeup.
- Only `app-server` rebuilt - verified first that `EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_USD` and `INCLUDED_SEATS` are
  consumed only by `app_server` code (`admin.py`, `frontend.py`); `scan_worker/jobs.py` imports
  `base_cap_for_plan`/`monthly_cap_for_installation` from the same `llm_cost.py` module but neither
  function reads either changed constant, so `scan-worker`'s behavior is unaffected and it was left
  untouched.
- Services running: same set as the previous snapshot, all `Up`; `app-server` reporting
  Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within seconds of recreation.
- No pending migrations - `app-server`'s startup log shows `no pending migrations`.
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded) by executing directly inside the
  running container: `app_server.llm_cost.EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_USD == 6.99`,
  `app_server.db.INCLUDED_SEATS == {'air': 3}`, `app_server.paddle_pricing.EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_ID ==
  'pri_01m123rwvvtgbm6bmmxcbav4hh'`.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server` logs in the 3 minutes after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10 (restore drill itself
  upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

## 2026-08-27 (third deploy) Snapshot

As of 2026-08-27 (third deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `12baf31`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 2 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-27-2`): #428 fixed
  `_PUSHOVER_KEY_PATTERN`'s bare `$` (which, without `re.MULTILINE`, matches just before a single
  trailing newline as well as true end-of-string) to `\Z`, so a 30-character Pushover key with a
  copy-paste trailing newline is now correctly rejected instead of silently accepted; #430 fixed
  `git_intel/incremental.py`'s `fold()` iterating `commits` in caller order (newest-first, matching
  real `git log`) while building `recent_commits` with `insert(0, ...)` - the two compounded to put
  the *oldest* commit at `recent_commits[0]` instead of the newest, which `jobs.py`'s
  `_commit_attachment_from_graph`/`_owner_attachment_from_graph` read directly as "the latest
  commit" for health-check-failure correlation and likely-owner inference on the hosted path.
  #430's own CI catalogued and fixed three test fixtures with an oldest-first mirror-image ordering
  bug that had been masking this; a fourth fixture (`github-app/tests/test_correlation.py`) was
  found and fixed the same way after the first CI run on this session's push still failed against
  it, verified locally against a real Postgres round-trip before re-pushing. See
  `github-app/CHANGELOG.md` for the full per-PR writeup.
- Rebuilt the same five services as the previous deploy (`admin.py` changed for #428;
  `git_intel/incremental.py` - part of the shared `aletheore` package `scan_worker` installs -
  changed for #430) - `demo-scan-worker` and `demo-sandbox-runner` again left untouched, neither's
  own source changed.
- Services running: same set as the previous snapshot, all `Up`; all five rebuilt services
  reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within seconds of recreation.
- No pending migrations - `app-server`'s startup log shows `no pending migrations`.
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded) by executing directly inside the
  running containers: `app_server.admin`'s live `_PUSHOVER_KEY_PATTERN` source contains `\Z`;
  `aletheore.git_intel.incremental.fold`'s live source contains `reversed(commits)`.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs in the 2 minutes after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10 (restore drill itself
  upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

## 2026-08-27 (second deploy) Snapshot

As of 2026-08-27 (second deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git reset --hard origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those five), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `d90bd87`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 20 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-27`) - the headline changes:
  #426 caps `ProcessPoolExecutor` parallel-parse worker count to the real available CPU quota
  (cgroup-aware, not raw `os.cpu_count()`); #427 redesigns the marketing site and the hosted
  dashboard's sign-in/repo-picker/overview with a light glass theme (dark mode changed from
  OS-auto to an explicit `data-theme="dark"` opt-in); #429 fixes FastAPI endpoint-mapping missing
  the mount prefix entirely for `include_router(module.router, prefix=...)`-style calls (only bare
  identifiers were handled before), which fed both the dashboard's endpoint list and the hosted
  health-check monitor with wrong paths; plus #409's `stop_grace_period` fix (`docker-compose.yml`,
  30m30s on scan-worker/scan-worker-2, 11m on health-worker) and #410's spend-cap check-then-act
  race fix were both already live at the previous deploy's commit but are included here for
  completeness. See `github-app/CHANGELOG.md` for the full per-PR writeup.
- Rebuilt all five app-relevant services this time (`app-server` included, unlike the previous
  deploy) since both `app_server/frontend.py` and `app_server/demo_scan_api.py` changed alongside
  `scan_worker/jobs.py` and `scan_worker/live_wiki.py` - `demo-scan-worker` and
  `demo-sandbox-runner` were left untouched since neither's own source changed (they build from
  separate Dockerfiles, confirmed via `docker-compose.yml`, not assumed).
- Services running: same set as the previous snapshot, all `Up`; all five rebuilt services
  reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within a minute of recreation.
- No pending migrations - `app-server`'s startup log shows `no pending migrations`.
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded) by executing directly inside the
  running containers, not by re-reading the repo: `app_server.frontend`'s live source contains
  `data-theme="dark"` (the explicit opt-in, replacing the old `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
  auto-follow) and the light-glass sign-in background (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65)`); `app_server.demo_scan_api`
  imports cleanly; `scan_worker.jobs` has `_run_scan`.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs in the 2 minutes after restart (targeted grep for
  `error|traceback|exception`).
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10 (restore drill itself
  upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

## 2026-08-27 (first deploy) Snapshot

As of 2026-08-27 (first deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git pull origin master` + `docker compose build scan-worker scan-worker-2 health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate` for those four - `app-server` deliberately left untouched, see below), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `3b89249`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 5 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-26-2`) - three real bugs in
  `scan_worker/jobs.py`, found by a proactive dual-pass audit (this session plus a second,
  independent Claude session auditing the same file for a fresh set of eyes) rather than a bug
  report: #405 (free-tier Flash Review falsely claiming a diff was reviewed clean, and advancing
  `last_reviewed_sha`, when every free-tier provider actually failed mid-review), #406 (PR scans
  permanently polluting the persisted default-branch git graph with unmerged commits via
  `_sync_persistent_git_graph`), and #407 (the direct sibling of #406 - `_sync_code_graph` had the
  identical unconditional-`GRAPH_BRANCH="default"`-write bug, corrupting the durable code graph).
  See `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s 2026-08-27 entry for the full writeup.
- Only `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, and `scheduler` were rebuilt - all four
  share `Dockerfile.scan-worker` and actually execute `scan_worker/jobs.py`, and (same gotcha as
  every prior multi-image deploy) compose tags each as its own separately-built image despite the
  shared Dockerfile, so each needed an explicit rebuild. `app-server` also bundles a copy of
  `scan_worker/` in its image, but its own source was grepped directly: every reference to these
  job functions is a string literal handed to RQ's `queue.enqueue(...)` (job name resolved and
  imported by the *worker* process that dequeues it, never by `app-server` itself) - confirmed no
  rebuild was needed for this fix to take effect.
- Services running: same set as the 2026-08-24 snapshot below, all `Up`; the four rebuilt services
  reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy` within seconds of recreation.
- No pending migrations - a code-only deploy, and `app-server` (the only service that runs
  `scripts/migrate.py`) wasn't even restarted this time.
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded) by importing `scan_worker.jobs`
  directly inside the running `scan-worker` container and inspecting real source via
  `inspect.getsource`, not by re-reading the repo: `run_pr_scan_job`'s source contains no call to
  `_sync_persistent_git_graph(` or `_sync_code_graph(` (both #406 and #407's fixes), and
  `_run_flash_review`'s source contains the `if free_tier_exhausted["value"]: return False` bail-out
  added by #405, ahead of the comment-posting/`set_last_reviewed_sha` calls it used to reach
  unconditionally.
- Health checks: internal `/healthz` returns `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, or
  `scheduler` logs in the 5 minutes after restart (targeted grep for `error|traceback|exception`).
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes, and `app-server` wasn't touched):
  Docker socket mount absence, non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image
  digest pinning, restore-drill target availability, disk space - each last directly verified
  2026-08-10 (restore drill itself upgraded 2026-08-24, see below).

## 2026-08-24 Snapshot

As of 2026-08-24, following a redeploy to `master` (`git reset --hard origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --scale scan-worker=2` for those four), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `23a94ab`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 6 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-23`) - two real fixes plus
  docs. #369: live-wiki/docs incremental update jobs could reload evidence from a *different,
  newer* scan than the one that enqueued them (`get_latest_evidence` read "whatever's newest
  right now" instead of the exact row persisted by the enqueuing scan) - found by our own Flash
  Review dogfooded on #364 the day before. Fixed by threading the specific `repo_history` row id
  through the queue and reloading by that exact id (`get_evidence_by_id`). #370: the concurrency-
  relevant two of five remaining second-pass-audit findings - health-check-target and API-token
  creation were check-then-act under concurrent requests (#24), and `generate_token` re-derived
  its id via a racy re-query instead of using `create_api_token`'s own return value (#25) - fixed
  with the same advisory-lock-wrapped CTE pattern `add_installation_member_within_seat_limit`
  already used, new lock namespaces 4/5 deliberately chosen to avoid the existing namespace-3
  collision (a separate, unfixed finding, #30). The other three findings in #370 (#19, #22, #26)
  live in the `aletheore` CLI package, not this backend - they ship with the next PyPI release,
  not this deploy. See `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s 2026-08-24 entry for the full writeup.
- `--scale scan-worker=2` on `up -d` again recreated both replicas cleanly under their expected
  names, no orphan.
- Services running: same set as the 2026-08-23 snapshot below, all `Up`; the four rebuilt services
  and `scan-worker`'s second replica reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy`.
- No pending migrations - a code-only deploy.
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded): `scan_worker.db.get_evidence_by_id`
  exists and is callable; both `run_live_wiki_incremental_update_job`/`run_live_docs_incremental_update_job`
  take a `history_id` parameter; `app_server.db.add_health_check_target_within_limit`/
  `create_api_token_within_limit` exist with `HEALTH_CHECK_TARGET_LOCK_NAMESPACE == 4`/
  `API_TOKEN_LOCK_NAMESPACE == 5`; `app_server.admin.generate_token`'s source confirmed calling
  `create_api_token_within_limit` and no longer referencing `list_api_tokens` - all checked by
  importing directly / inspecting source in the running containers, not by re-reading the repo.
- Health checks: internal and public `/healthz` both return `200 {"status":"ok",...}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server`, `scan-worker-1`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs in the 5 minutes after restart.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, disk space -
  each last directly verified 2026-08-10. **Restore drill upgraded beyond "target availability"
  this same day (2026-08-24) - see the dedicated section below**, a real restore-and-verify, not
  just confirming a target database is reachable.

## 2026-08-23 Snapshot

As of 2026-08-23, following a redeploy to `master` (`git reset --hard origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --scale scan-worker=2` for those four), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Commit: `f992751`.
- Working tree: clean aside from the expected untracked `github-app/backups/` directory.
- 5 commits since the previous deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-22-2`) - triggered by a user
  report of the `ops_monitor.failed_jobs.scans` alert repeatedly hitting `support@aletheore.com`.
  Root-caused to two compounding bugs, both fixed this deploy: AIRview/Docs incremental updates
  sharing the PR/push scan job's 300s `job_timeout` and getting killed mid-flight by RQ on large
  repos (#364), and the ops/error alert cooldown being 900s (15min) instead of the intended 6
  hours (#365) - see `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s 2026-08-23 entry for the full writeup.
- `--scale scan-worker=2` on `up -d` again recreated both replicas cleanly under their expected
  names, no orphan.
- Services running: same set as the 2026-08-22 snapshot below, all `Up`; the four rebuilt services
  and `scan-worker`'s second replica reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy`.
- No pending migrations - a code-only deploy.
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded): `scan_worker.jobs.OPS_ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS == 21600`,
  `app_server.error_alerts._ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS == 21600`, `LIVE_WIKI_INCREMENTAL_UPDATE_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS ==
  LIVE_DOCS_INCREMENTAL_UPDATE_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS == 600`, and both `run_live_wiki_incremental_update_job` /
  `run_live_docs_incremental_update_job` exist and are callable - all checked by importing directly
  in the running `scan-worker` container, not by re-reading source.
- Inspected the `scans` queue's `FailedJobRegistry` directly (not assumed): found 5 stale entries
  predating this deploy (2 from an already-explained orphan-container artifact of the first
  2026-08-22 deploy, 3 from the timeout bug just fixed) - cleared all 5 so the new 6h cooldown
  didn't start by re-alerting on already-resolved history. Confirmed both monitored queues
  (`scans`, `health`) at `depth=0 failed=0` after clearing.
- Watched a live `run_ops_monitor_job` execution in `scan-worker`'s logs mid-verification (it runs
  every ~3min on the `scans` queue): one alert legitimately fired during the window before the
  stale registry was cleared (Resend `POST /emails` returned `200 OK`), then set a ~6h Redis
  cooldown key (`ops_monitor:alert_cooldown:ops_monitor.failed_jobs.scans`, confirmed via `TTL`)
  - the exact "one alert, then quiet" behavior #365 was meant to produce, observed directly rather
  than inferred from the diff.
- Health checks: internal and public `/healthz` both return `200 {"status":"ok",...}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions in `app-server`, `scan-worker-1`, `scan-worker-2`,
  `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs after restart, aside from the one expected ops-alert log
  line above.
- Not re-verified this pass (no relevant Dockerfile/host changes): Docker socket mount absence,
  non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill
  target availability, disk space - each last directly verified 2026-08-10.

## 2026-08-22 (second deploy) Snapshot

As of 2026-08-22 (second deploy), following a redeploy to `master` (`git reset --hard origin/master` + `docker compose build app-server scan-worker health-worker scheduler` + `docker compose up -d --no-deps --scale scan-worker=2` for those four), live inspection found:

- Host: the production host.
- Deployment path: `/root/aletheore`.
- Remote: `https://github.com/Aletheore/Aletheore.git`.
- Branch: `master`.
- Commit: `09cfdda8a26793e019ed95162964d5a1f34c1d2d`.
- Working tree: clean aside from an untracked `github-app/backups/` directory (expected - backup script output, not repo content), no local diffs or stashes.
- 6 commits since the first same-day deploy tag (`github-app-deploy-2026-08-22`) - see `github-app/CHANGELOG.md`'s "second deploy" entry. Headline changes: three crash/broken-feature bugs from the second-pass audit (an unguarded-`.decode()` scan-abort, an RRF-fusion `TypeError` crash in AIRview Q&A, and a `NameError` that silently broke AIRview's non-scanned-file fallback - #360), plus a new ops-monitor check alerting when a free-tier provider key goes missing (#357, closing the exact gap this same day's free-tier key-sync incident exposed).
- Passing `--scale scan-worker=2` on the `up -d` command itself (not as a separate follow-up call) recreated both replicas cleanly under their expected names (`scan-worker-1`, `scan-worker-2`) with no orphan - confirms the 2026-08-22 (first deploy) finding: the plain service-name form doesn't reliably recreate every replica, but including `--scale` from the start avoids the problem entirely rather than needing a manual cleanup pass.
- Services running: `app-server`, `scan-worker` (2 replicas), `health-worker`, `scheduler`, `autoheal`, `demo-scan-worker`, `demo-sandbox-runner`, `postgres`, `redis`, `caddy`, `jina-embed` - all `Up`; the four rebuilt services and `scan-worker`'s second replica all reporting Docker-healthcheck `healthy`.
- App server starts via `python scripts/migrate.py && exec uvicorn ...`; this redeploy carried no pending migrations (`no pending migrations` in logs) - a code-only deploy.
- Post-deploy, verified live (not just that the deploy succeeded) that all three #360 fixes and the #357 addition are actually present in the running code: `dashboard._fetch_wiki_file_content_sync` calls `_github_http_client()` not the unimported `get_github_api_client()`; `search_index._rrf_fuse` merges hit dicts (`by_key.get(key, {})`) instead of overwriting; `answer.answer_question` has the `top_score is not None` guard; `scanner.graph` has zero remaining bare `.decode()` calls (43 guarded); `scan_worker.jobs` has `_check_free_tier_provider_keys`. Also re-confirmed the four free-tier provider keys (synced earlier the same day) survived the restart - `has_api_key()` still returns `True` for all four.
- Health checks: internal `http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz` and public `https://app.aletheore.com/healthz` both return `200 {"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","redis":"ok"}}`.
- No errors, tracebacks, or exceptions found in `app-server`, `scan-worker-1`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, or `scheduler` logs after restart (targeted grep for `error|traceback|exception`).
- Not re-verified this pass (out of scope, no relevant Dockerfile/script changes in the diff): Docker socket mount absence, non-root users, CPU/mem limits, backup cron execution, base-image digest pinning, restore-drill target availability, disk space.

## Restore Drill (2026-08-24)

Previously only "the backup file gets created on schedule" (2026-08-10) and "the restore-drill
target database is reachable" (last checked with every deploy above) had been verified - neither
proves a restore actually *works*. This is the first real restore-and-verify:

Copied the latest real backup (`aletheore_app_2026-08-24T03-00-01Z.dump`, 35.7MB) off the
production server via `scp`, confirmed byte-identical transfer (`md5sum` matched server vs. local
copy before touching it), restored into a fresh, empty, throwaway local Postgres 16 container
(matching prod's Postgres version) via `pg_restore`. Verified against live production, not just
that the restore "looked" successful:

- All 49 tables restored, zero `pg_restore` errors.
- Row counts for 8 spot-checked tables matched live production exactly
  (`installations`, `api_tokens`, `repo_history`, `affiliates`, `affiliate_referrals`, `sessions`,
  `sent_emails`, `schema_migrations`).
- Actual values matched too: all 3 `installations` rows identical (id/login/plan); the restored
  snapshot's most-recent `repo_history` row confirmed (by exact timestamp) to still exist in live
  prod's full history - proving real continuity, not coincidentally-equal counts.
- Ran the app's real `scripts/migrate.py` against the restored DB: **"no pending migrations"** -
  the restored schema is genuinely current with what the running application code expects.
- Spot-checked a 273KB `evidence` JSONB blob for corruption: valid `jsonb_typeof`, real
  `aletheore_version` field intact.
- Local copy and throwaway container both destroyed immediately after verification - the dump
  contains real production data and wasn't left lying around.

**The backup-and-restore path genuinely works.** Re-run this drill if the backup script, Postgres
major version, or schema-migration tooling changes in a way that could affect restorability.

## Free-Tier Flash Review Provider Keys (live server config, not in git)

`writing_adapter_chain_for_free_tier` in `scan_worker/model_tiers.py` builds its fallback chain
from four env vars (`GROQ_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_FREE_TIER_API_KEY`,
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), each silently skipped if unset - the code has no way to tell "no key
configured" apart from "operator hasn't gotten to this provider yet", so an empty chain fails
silent, not loud (`jobs.py` logs a warning and returns `False`, no user-facing error, no alert).

As of 2026-08-22, confirmed all four keys are set in production's `github-app/.env` (checked via
`has_api_key()` boolean return values only - the actual values never appear in any command output,
log, or file under version control) and `scan-worker`/`health-worker` have been restarted to pick
them up. Before this, all four had been present in the *local* `.env` for an unknown period but
never synced to the server, meaning every free-tier Flash Review was silently no-op'ing in
production despite the feature's code being fully implemented, tested, and deployed. If this
regresses (e.g. a future server rebuild from a fresh `.env` template), the symptom is the same as
before: free-tier reviews silently stop happening, with only a log line to notice by. Re-verify with
the four `has_api_key()` checks above after any `.env`-affecting change, not just after a code
redeploy - env drift is invisible to `git diff` and to every check in this document above this one.

## Paddle Webhook Destination (live account config, not in git)

The set of events Paddle actually delivers to `/webhooks/paddle` is configured on Paddle's side
(notification destination `ntfset_01kyksktbmvr49pyygmxa3vfjz`), not in this repository - adding a
new event handler in `app_server/webhooks/paddle.py` does **not** make Paddle start sending that
event type. Confirmed via the Paddle API (`notificationSettings.list`/`.get`) that this destination
is currently subscribed to `subscription.canceled`, `subscription.created`, `subscription.paused`,
`subscription.resumed`, `subscription.updated`, and `transaction.completed`.

`transaction.completed` was added 2026-08-10 alongside the affiliate-commission feature - it was
initially missing (the destination predates that handler and was never updated), which would have
made the entire commission-recording code path permanently unreachable in production despite
passing all tests, since tests exercise the handler directly rather than real Paddle delivery. This
is now a standing check: any new webhook handler for an event type not already in the list above
needs both the code AND this destination's `subscribed_events` updated, verified live via
`notificationSettings.get`, not assumed from the code change alone.

## Recovery Rule

If any deployed state differs from repository expectations, treat production as stale until the exact commit and Compose configuration are verified.

## Deploy History

This file is a snapshot of *current* production state — it gets overwritten on every redeploy, so
it never shows what was live last week. For that, every production deploy is tagged
`github-app-deploy-YYYY-MM-DD` (append `-N` for a second same-day deploy), and
[`../../github-app/CHANGELOG.md`](../../github-app/CHANGELOG.md) has a dated, human-readable entry
per deploy. `git tag -l 'github-app-deploy-*'` lists every tracked deploy point;
`git log <prev-tag>..<tag>` gives the exact commit range for any one of them.
