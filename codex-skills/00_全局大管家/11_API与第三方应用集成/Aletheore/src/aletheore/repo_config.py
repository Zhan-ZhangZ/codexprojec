    (matches zero or more whole segments); a plain "*"/"?" stays scoped to
    one segment via fnmatch, matching real gitignore semantics rather than
    fnmatch's own no-path-awareness "*" (which matches straight through

    "**" branch with no memoization forks into len(candidate_segments)+1
    calls, and a pattern with several "**" segments multiplies that
    branching at every level - exponential in the number of "**" segments.

    untrusted input by design, so a crafted config is a real
    denial-of-service vector - confirmed directly, a 10x"**" pattern
    against a 25-segment path took ~60s before this fix. Memoizing by
    (pattern index, candidate index) - scoped to this one call, not a
    module-level cache, so it can't grow across unrelated calls - bounds
    the whole match to O(len(pattern_segments) * len(candidate_segments))
