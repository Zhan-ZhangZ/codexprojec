# A bare CamelCase constant reference, optionally namespaced with `::`
# (User, Admin::UserHistory), and optionally anchored with a LEADING `::`
# (::Jobs::TopicTimerBase - Ruby's own "start lookup at the absolute
# top-level namespace" syntax, real and common enough that a superclass
# reference is routinely written this way to disambiguate against a
# same-named nested constant). The leading `(?:::)?` is consumed but not
# captured - group(1) is always just the constant name itself, with no
# leading colons in the stored token.
#
# Real bug found via a real Discourse scan (68,183-commit clone): every
# one of its own job-hierarchy superclass references
# (`class CloseTopic < ::Jobs::TopicTimerBase`) uses this exact leading-
# `::` form, and the original `(?<![:\w])` lookbehind rejected a match
# starting right after the leading `::`'s own second colon - not just for
# the whole "Jobs::TopicTimerBase" run, but for EVERY position inside it
# (including a later attempt at the bare "TopicTimerBase" tail, since
# that position is also colon-preceded) - so a real superclass reference
# written this way was completely invisible to this index, not just
# imprecisely captured.
#
# Flash Review finding on this same fix's first attempt (which simply
# dropped `:` from the lookbehind everywhere, not just before a genuine
# leading `::`): reproduced directly - "registry::User" (a lowercase
# expression, itself never matching `[A-Z]`, "::"-qualified into a
# constant that is NOT the top-level Zeitwerk `User`) let the lookbehind
# alone accept a match starting right at "User", since a colon isn't a
# `\w` character either. That first attempt's own comment claimed
# finditer's greedy scan already prevented this the way it does for
# "Admin::User" - true only when the qualifying prefix is itself
# `[A-Z]`-starting and so gets absorbed into one earlier match; false
# here, since "registry" never matches `[A-Z]` at all and so is never
# consumed by anything, leaving "User" free to start its own match.
#
# Fixed with two distinct alternatives instead of one shared lookbehind:
# a leading `::` is allowed ONLY when it is itself not preceded by a word
# character (a genuine absolute-top-level reference, `(?<!\w)::` followed
# by the constant) - not just anywhere a colon happens to precede an
# uppercase letter. Every other position keeps the original, stricter
# `(?<![:\w])` rule with no leading `::` consumed at all.
#
# Known, deliberate limitation: this is a plain text scan, not a real
# parse - a class name mentioned only inside a `#` comment or a string
# literal (a log message, an error string) counts as a "reference" the
# same as real code would. Consistent with this file's existing bias
# everywhere else (favor not flagging live code dead over precision), and

    Real gap this closes (issue #675): Zeitwerk's own path-to-constant
    inference (_ruby_zeitwerk_constant_candidates above) assumes every
    subdirectory under an app/<root> autoload root is a plain, unmodified
    namespace segment - true by default, but a real Rails app can change
    that per-directory via a custom Zeitwerk inflector
    (`autoloader.inflector.inflect(...)`) or a namespaced autoload root
    (`push_dir(dir, namespace: X)`), neither of which is visible from a
    file's path alone. Confirmed on a real repo (discourse/discourse):
    app/jobs/regular/topic_timer_base.rb is genuinely referenced
    elsewhere as `::Jobs::TopicTimerBase`, not `Regular::TopicTimerBase` -
    Discourse's own config/initializers/000-zeitwerk.rb remaps the
    "regular"/"scheduled"/"onceoff" directory basenames to camelize as
    "Jobs" instead of their natural form, specifically so files in those
    directories collapse into the same `Jobs` namespace as their parent
    rather than gaining an extra nesting level - invisible from a
    directory listing, since nothing about that remapping appears in the
    file's own path.

    Whatever the underlying mechanism, Zeitwerk's own contract guarantees
    the file must still literally define the constant it's mapped to
    (compact - `class Jobs::TopicTimerBase` - or nested -
    `module Jobs; class TopicTimerBase`), so reading the file's own
    module/class nesting directly is correct regardless of which
    mechanism (or a future one this codebase has never seen) is
    responsible - unlike trying to model Zeitwerk's inference rules
    themselves, which would need a fixed set of cases to special-case.

    Nesting is reconstructed from each declaration line's own leading
    whitespace, not by tracking `end` keywords - counting every `end` in
    the file would also count one closing a `def`/`if`/`do`/`case`/
    `begin` block, not just a `module`/`class`, and misalign the stack
    long before reaching the target declaration. Indentation is a
    reliable proxy for real Ruby/Rails source, which the rubocop/standard
    ecosystem keeps close to universally consistent.

    Real bug found via audit, two parts:

    1. Heredoc bodies (SQL, example code, anything a job/model file might
       build as a string) are skipped before this scan even sees them
       (_ruby_lines_outside_heredocs) - without it, heredoc content that
       textually resembles a class/module declaration was read as real
       Ruby syntax, and since this function used to return on the first
       leaf-matching declaration in file order, a fabricated declaration
       appearing before the real one could hijack the result with a
       WRONG constant, not just a missing one - the one way this
       function's otherwise-additive design (a bad candidate can only
       ever add a spurious rescue, never cause a false-dead) could
       actually misfire.

    2. Real Ruby lets a class be reopened (adding to it from more than
       one place) - a leaf-matching declaration is no longer accepted on
       first sight; every one in the file is considered, and the one with
       the MOST enclosing context wins. A bare, unnamespaced stub
       (`class TopicTimerBase; end`) appearing before the file's real,
       namespaced definition used to win by virtue of coming first,
       silently dropping the namespace a later reopening actually
       supplies.

    Indent comparison uses each line's raw, unexpanded whitespace length
    (not .expandtabs()) - expanding to a fixed 8-column tab stop made a
    single real tab (len 8 once expanded) look deeper than two real
    spaces (len 2), inverting a genuinely shallower tab-indented
    enclosing line's own position in the stack. Raw length has no such
    inversion for any single consistent indent unit, tabs or spaces.

    autoloader, active by default since Rails 6 - would map this file to:
    app/models/admin/user_history.rb -> ["Admin::UserHistory",
    "UserHistory"]. Every immediate subdirectory of app/ is its own
    autoload root by Rails convention regardless of what it's named
    (models, jobs, mailers, services, serializers, channels, policies,
    ... - no fixed directory allowlist needed, unlike the framework-
    specific entry-point heuristics elsewhere in this file), so only
    app/<root>/... is handled - lib/ is autoloaded only when an app
    explicitly opts in via config.autoload_paths, which this module has no
    way to see.

    The full namespaced name is the precise match; the bare last segment
    is a deliberately permissive fallback for Ruby's own lexical constant
    lookup, where code already nested under (or sitting alongside) the
    same namespace commonly refers to a sibling by its short name alone
    (Ruby itself would resolve it the same way) - e.g. code inside
    `module Admin` referring to `UserHistory` without ever spelling out
    `Admin::`. This trades a narrow false-negative risk (an unrelated
    class elsewhere in the app happening to share the same bare name)
    for closing a false-positive rate that was 100% on every real Rails
    app/ subdirectory tested (Discourse: models, jobs, mailers, services,
    serializers) - consistent with this file's existing bias everywhere
    else toward not flagging live code dead over never missing a

# bare `:some_common_word` symbol used as plain data (not a dispatch
# target at all) registered exactly the same as a real
# `Jobs.enqueue(:bump_topic, ...)` call, since nothing in the old pattern
# actually required call-argument position - only the trailing "keyword-
# label" shape was excluded, not every other place a bare symbol can
# legally appear. Fixed by requiring the symbol to be the first thing
# after a call's opening parenthesis, preceded by what looks like a
# method reference (an identifier, optionally `.`/`::`-chained) -
# verified this still matches every real shape confirmed on Discourse

    Resolved the same way _infer_xcodeproj_swift_targets resolves an Xcode
    target's file membership: basename search under the repo root, keeping
    only an unambiguous single match. A manifest entry names a class, not a
    file path (and android:name's shorthand form, ".TodoApplication", isn't
    even a full class name) - reconstructing a path from it would have to
    guess which of app/src/main/java/, .../kotlin/, or a build-flavor
    source set actually holds the file, so this takes just the simple class
    name (the segment after the last '.') and lets the basename search
    handle the rest, same as the Xcode case.

    """Every Kotlin or Java file sharing a package with a file that's
    reachable some other way - the same blind spot _swift_target_reachable_files
    above already handles for Swift's whole-target visibility, just at
    package instead of target granularity.

    Kotlin files in the same package see each other's top-level
    declarations (classes, objects, and - real repo confirmed - top-level
    functions) with no import statement at all, unlike every other
    supported language here. Confirmed on a real repo
    (android/architecture-samples): DefaultTaskRepository.kt calls
    ModelMappingExt.kt's toExternal() with zero import statement - both
    declared in the same package, and DefaultTaskRepository.kt is
    independently reachable (bound into Hilt's DI graph via
    DataModules.kt). StatisticsUtils.kt is the same shape one package
    over: unreachable itself, but sharing a package with the
    @HiltViewModel-annotated StatisticsViewModel.kt.

    Plain Java has the identical rule (JLS 7.5.1: no import needed for a
    same-package type) - confirmed directly: two ordinary .java files
    declaring the same package, one calling the other's static method with
    zero import, produced zero edge between them in build_module_graph.
    Originally this function only grouped .kt/.kts files, so every
    same-package-only-referenced .java file (the ordinary shape for any
    small-to-medium Java package, not an edge case) still looked
    unreachable - the exact same blind spot already fixed for Kotlin,
    silently never extended to the other JVM language this scanner
    supports. Grouping Kotlin and Java files under the same package name
    together (rather than keeping two separate maps) is deliberate, not
    incidental: a real mixed-language Android/JVM project has both
    languages sharing one package's visibility, by the JVM's own rules.

    A package's own reachability is judged by the same signals
    find_dead_code already treats as reachable on their own (imported_by,
    a manifest entry point, a Hilt/Dagger annotation, or - Java only - its
    own public static void main) - propagating from an already-
    independently-reachable sibling is the whole point, so requiring
    anything more here would just miss the real cases above.
    Test files are excluded from the grouping entirely (not just left to
    fall through) so a test file's own package-mate status can never leak
    reachability into a production sibling that happens to share its
    package name, which Android's own androidTest/test convention often
    does.

    Rails lowercases it, Laravel's convention capitalizes it
    "Controllers"). Confirmed by a real end-to-end test: without this, an

    "app/controllers/admin/badges_controller.rb" two levels down, colliding
    with the real top-level app/controllers/badges_controller.rb - Rails'
    own unqualified `resources :badges`, declared directly in

    `anchor_single_segment=False` (see the config/routes.rb-only gating in

    the engine's own module (isolate_namespace) regardless of anything the
    routes file itself says, a segment this extractor has no way to see
    since it isn't a namespace/scope call at all. Anchoring there would
    wrongly reject the one real controller (e.g.
    plugins/discourse-workflows/app/controllers/discourse_workflows/
    workflows_controller.rb) an unprefixed plugin route already uniquely
    identifies, just because that untracked engine-module segment sits
    between "controllers/" and it.

    A multi-segment (prefixed) query is always a plain tail match with no
    adjacency requirement, for the same untracked-engine-segment reason -
    e.g. a `namespace :api do resources :channels end` inside the chat
    plugin's own engine-mounted routes file records "api/channels", but the

# This re-reads each Python/JS/TS source file directly and regex-extracts

# resolvers keep, since that field also feeds the import GRAPH (edges,
# imported_by, hotspots, MCP's aletheore_imports) where only real
# repo-internal edges belong; conflating "resolved" and "external, only
# useful for this one check" into the same field would be a much larger,
# riskier change than this narrowly-scoped, single-purpose regex pass.
