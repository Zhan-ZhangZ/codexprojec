"""On-demand structural code search: match a raw tree-sitter query against
every parsed file of one language in a repository.

Unlike the rest of `aletheore query`, this reads and re-parses source from
disk at query time rather than reading cached `.aletheore/air.json`
evidence - a structural pattern match needs the actual parse tree, which
air.json never stores (the extracted symbol/import facts are a small
summary derived from it, not the tree itself).

Only user of tree_sitter's Query/QueryCursor API in this codebase - every
other module uses Parser/Tree/Node directly. That distinction matters: this
module's real-repo use of Query/QueryCursor segfaults reliably on Python
3.14 once enough files/matches accumulate for the cyclic GC to touch the
resulting Node/Tree/QueryCursor object graph (this used to be why
`requires-python` was capped below 3.14; the cap was lifted once the FIX below was
verified on 3.14). Not fixed by explicit `del`,
`gc.disable()`, or forced `gc.collect()` per iteration - tried all three,
none prevented it.

CORRECTION (2026-09-04, dead-code/ast-pattern overnight benchmark pass):
this module's own prior claim that "the exact same code runs clean on
3.12" was false for real repos at real scale - it was only ever verified
against this project's own ~116 source files. Confirmed directly on
Python 3.12.10, tree-sitter 0.26.0: a low-match-density query
(`(try_statement) @try`) against Django's real ~2,930-file Python tree
segfaults reliably - reproduced independently a second time the same day
(3 of 4 runs, exit code 139 each time; the one clean run confirms this is
probabilistic/timing-dependent, not deterministic - consistent with a
memory-corruption-class bug, not a logic bug). The crash correlates with
*files fully processed before any cap triggers*, not language, matches
found, or Python version alone - a query selective enough to run long
against a big enough repo can hit this on 3.11/3.12 too, inside the
officially supported range, not only on the already-excluded 3.14.

FIX (2026-09-04): batched subprocess isolation. Each batch of
_AST_PATTERN_BATCH_SIZE files runs in its own fresh worker process
(ProcessPoolExecutor with max_tasks_per_child=1 - the default reuses one
worker across every submitted task, which would recreate the exact same
unbounded accumulation this fix exists to prevent). A segfault kills that
one batch's worker, not the whole call: caught as BrokenProcessPool,
every earlier batch's real results are kept, the remainder is marked
truncated - the same honest-truncation contract _AST_PATTERN_MATCH_CAP/
_AST_PATTERN_TOTAL_CHAR_BUDGET already use, not a silent gap. Verified

CORRECTION (backward audit, this session): the original fix only caught
BrokenProcessPool, so any OTHER exception inside a batch's worker (a bug
in match/capture processing, MemoryError/RecursionError on a pathological
file) propagated out of search_ast_pattern entirely, discarding every
earlier batch's real results - not the honest-truncation contract the
rest of this docstring claims. A hung worker (an infinite loop, not a
crash) had no time bound at all either. Both fixed: future.result() now
takes a timeout, and any exception (not just BrokenProcessPool) marks the
result truncated and returns what was already collected, same as a
segfault.
against the exact case that crashed above: `(try_statement) @try` against
Django's real tree, 20 consecutive runs, 0 crashes (see
benchmarks/ast-pattern-benchmark/ for the full before/after methodology).
Chosen over the two mitigations this module previously flagged as
untried-and-risky: unbatched (one-process-per-call) subprocess isolation
doesn't actually fix anything (the same accumulation happens inside that
one child); pre-emptive file-count truncation needs a threshold with no
clean way to calibrate it, and is silently wrong if that guess is off -
batching costs real per-batch subprocess-spawn latency too, but a wrong
batch-size guess degrades to "that batch's worker dies, cleanly caught,
marked truncated," never a silently incomplete result.

VERIFIED ON 3.14 ITSELF (2026-09-04, same pass): the crash does reproduce
on 3.14 (tree-sitter 0.26.0) - but not from one big single-process call
the way it does on 3.12. 16 consecutive single-call runs of a
full-scan-forcing query (`(match_statement) @m` against Django, 4 real
matches) were all clean; the crash only appeared when the SAME unfixed
process called `search_ast_pattern` repeatedly without restarting -
exactly how a long-lived MCP server process actually behaves (one call
per tool invocation, same process). Segfaulted (exit 139) on the 3rd
repeated call. This means single-call testing alone understates real
risk on 3.14: the object graph accumulates *across* calls, not only
within one. The fix holds under this harder, more realistic scenario
too - 20 consecutive repeated in-process calls of the same query, 0
crashes, because each call's own ProcessPoolExecutor tears its workers
down at call end, so nothing carries over into the next call's object
graph regardless of how many calls the parent process lives through.
