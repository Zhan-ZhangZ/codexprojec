    Deterministic, no LLM. Four signals, all already in the evidence:

    - in-degree: how many modules import this one
    - churn: how often git touches it
    - size: how many symbols it defines
    - public API: whether a package `__init__.py` re-exports it

    The last two exist because in-degree alone systematically under-ranks the
    files a reader most wants explained. Entry points sit at the *top* of the
    import tree, so almost nothing imports them, while leaf utilities are
    imported by everything. Both failures were measured, not hypothesised:
    Flask's `app.py` placed 15th on in-degree alone, below `typing.py`; and on
    in-degree plus size, requests' `api.py` - which defines `get`/`post`/`put`
    and is the entire public API - placed 17th and received no page, while
    `compat.py`, a compatibility shim, placed 1st.

    Tests, examples and docs are demoted rather than dropped - a repo that is
    mostly tests should still document something.
