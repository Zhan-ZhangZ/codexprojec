"""Detects exported function signature changes between two evidence
snapshots (a PR's base and head scans), and cross-references the
dependency graph's own imported_by data to find files that import the
changed function's module but weren't touched in the same PR - the
"you changed this signature, but N dependents weren't updated" gap
Regression Fencing closes.

Deliberately file/import-level, not a full call graph: a file being
flagged here means it imports the module containing the changed
function, not necessarily that it calls that specific function - no
call-graph/reference tracking exists (or is planned) at that
granularity. This matches what the dependency graph actually tracks
today and is a genuine, real signal even at that coarser level.
