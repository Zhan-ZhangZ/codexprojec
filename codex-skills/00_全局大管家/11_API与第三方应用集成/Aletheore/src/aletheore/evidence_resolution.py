    Real bug found via audit (same class already fixed in repo_config.py's
    _segments_match, same session): a naive recursive "**" branch with no

    segment, exponential in the number of "**" segments a pattern has. A
    CODEOWNERS file (CODEOWNERS, .github/CODEOWNERS, or docs/CODEOWNERS)
    lives inside the scanned repo itself - untrusted input by design, the
    same threat model ignored_paths already has - so a crafted pattern is
    a real, currently-live denial-of-service vector: confirmed directly,
    a pattern with ten "**" segments against a 25-segment path took ~65s
    before this fix. Memoized by (pattern index, path index), scoped to
    this one call (not a module-level cache, so it can't grow across

    A citation can fall inside more than one candidate range at once (a
    method's own range is a strict subset of its containing class's) -
    when that happens, the narrowest (innermost) match wins, since the
    method name is the more useful attribution for a line-level finding
    than its enclosing class.

    Returns None - never a guess - when the location isn't inside any
    known symbol: module-level code, a file the scan pass never covered
    (including a recognized-but-grammar-less language, e.g. .scala), or
