    Real bug this closes: _save_key/clear_api_key used to read the whole
    file, modify a plain in-memory dict, then write the whole file back
    as three independent, UNLOCKED steps. Two CLI invocations started
    close together (a real, plausible scenario - a user with two
    terminal tabs, or an interactive run overlapping a CI job) could both
    read the file's original state before either wrote, so whichever
    wrote last silently discarded the other's saved key - with no error
    surfaced to the process whose own save call returned normally.
    Confirmed directly: process A saves "anthropic", process B (reading
    that same pre-A state) saves "gemini" - the file ends up holding only
    "gemini"; "anthropic" is gone with no indication it never landed.

    Platform-conditional locking (fcntl on POSIX, msvcrt on Windows)
