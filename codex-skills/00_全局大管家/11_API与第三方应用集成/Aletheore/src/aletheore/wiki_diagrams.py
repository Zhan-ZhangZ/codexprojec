"""Deterministic mermaid diagram generation for the Live Wiki.

Diagram structure (which nodes exist, which edges connect them) is derived
entirely from the scanner's own dependency graph and cluster data - never
from an LLM. This guarantees a diagram can never show a relationship that
doesn't actually exist in the code. Human-readable labels (subsystem names)
are supplied by the caller once a naming pass has run; without them, nodes
fall back to a generic "Cluster N" label so this module is independently
testable and usable before naming happens.

    # guarantee that "a diagram can never show a relationship that doesn't
    # actually exist in the code." Collapsing newlines/carriage returns to
    # a space keeps a multi-line model response on the label's own single
    # line instead of letting it spill onto new Mermaid statements.
