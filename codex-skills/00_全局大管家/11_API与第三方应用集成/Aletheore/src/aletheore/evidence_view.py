"""Bounded reads of the audit evidence.

The audit's tool loop re-sends the whole conversation on every round, so an
oversized evidence read is paid for again on each later round. Measured on this
repository: one read of the top-level `repository` section returned about 260,000
tokens (`repository.modules` alone is two thirds of the whole evidence), and a
single audit then sent 4.9 million input tokens. The model needed a few thousand
tokens of it.

A read that fits within the budget is returned exactly as before. A larger one
comes back as an outline (large children named, with their size and the path to
read) or as the first page of a list, with the exact path for the next page, so
nothing is lost: everything is still reachable, it just has to be asked for.
