"""Deterministic database-schema extraction from a repository's own DDL
migrations - Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, or Oracle, detected from
the repo's own config (see the dialect-detection note below).

Produces the `repository.database.schema` AIR section: the tables, columns,
foreign-key relations, indexes, and CHECK constraints a repository's
migrations define, each resolving to the file:line that introduced it.

Every relation carries a `name`: an explicit `CONSTRAINT name FOREIGN KEY
...` uses it as given, and an unnamed single-column FK is auto-named
following Postgres' own real, documented default convention
(`<table>_<column>_fkey`) rather than left nameless - not a guess, the
same name Postgres itself would assign. This is what makes a later `ALTER
TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT <name>` resolvable (removes the matching
relation) instead of always falling to `unsupported`; a name that matches
no tracked relation - most likely a named UNIQUE/CHECK/PRIMARY KEY
constraint, not individually addressable yet - still falls back to
`unsupported` with the real statement text, never silently no-ops.

Parsing is via sqlglot rather than a hand-written tokenizer (which this
module used through 2026-09-04). The hand-written tokenizer silently
dropped every table-level constraint except FOREIGN KEY - a composite
`PRIMARY KEY (a, b)` (the ordinary shape for every join/junction table)
came back with no column marked `primary_key` at all, with no
`unsupported` entry to say why. sqlglot is MIT-licensed, has zero
transitive dependencies of its own (a pure-Python wheel, not a compiled
grammar needing per-platform wheels), and its AST cleanly discriminates
every CREATE/ALTER/DROP action this module replays. Line numbers are not
exposed on sqlglot's parsed expressions, so this module splits the file
into statements itself first using sqlglot's own tokenizer (which already
handles Postgres string literals and dollar-quoted bodies correctly - no
need to re-track quote/comment/depth state by hand) purely to record each
statement's starting line, then parses each statement's text individually.

Why not regex, still: a backtracking pattern over attacker-supplied SQL is
the exact shape of the ReDoS fixed in PR #190. Not a concern here - this
module never builds its own backtracking pattern; sqlglot's tokenizer is a
linear-time hand-written scanner, the same design this module used before.

The SQL dialect (postgres/mysql/sqlite/tsql/oracle) is read from a real,
explicit config file the repo itself already has - a Prisma
`schema.prisma`'s `datasource` block, `alembic.ini`'s `sqlalchemy.url`
scheme, Rails' `database.yml` `adapter:`, Django `settings.py`'s `ENGINE`,
or a `knexfile.js`/`.sequelizerc`'s `client`/`dialect` - never inferred
from the SQL text itself (see `_detect_sql_dialect`): a wrong guess there
could silently produce a plausible-looking but factually wrong schema, a
materially worse failure mode than this module's ordinary honest
"recorded as unsupported" fallback. Falls back to postgres, this module's
original and still most common target, when no such file is found.

Deliberately narrower than any of those dialects, regardless of which one
is active: CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, DROP TABLE, DROP INDEX, every
ALTER TABLE action with a clear, unambiguous DDL meaning (ADD/DROP/RENAME
COLUMN, RENAME TO, ALTER COLUMN TYPE/SET-DROP NOT NULL/SET DEFAULT, ADD
CONSTRAINT UNIQUE/FOREIGN KEY/PRIMARY KEY/CHECK, and - where the name
resolves - DROP CONSTRAINT), and CHECK constraints (column- or
table-level, named or not - stored as `{name, column, expression}` on the
owning table, `expression` the real reconstructed SQL text rather than an
evaluated boolean, since evaluating an arbitrary CHECK expression is not
this module's job) are modeled. EXCLUDE constraints, an unresolvable DROP
CONSTRAINT, views, sequences, types, extensions, functions/triggers,
GRANT/REVOKE, and raw DML are recorded in `unsupported` (with the real
reconstructed SQL text, not a truncated token dump) rather than modeled -
a repository is free to contain SQL this does not model, and a partial
schema is more useful than a failed scan. Never raises on malformed SQL: a
statement sqlglot cannot parse falls back to a generic Command node scoped
to that one statement, not the whole file; a file with a truly
unterminated string or dollar-quote (which sqlglot's tokenizer cannot
recover from at all, unlike an ordinary unparseable statement) is
re-tokenized up to the error's own reported position to salvage whatever
complete statements came before it, with an `unsupported` entry noting the
rest of the file was unreadable.
