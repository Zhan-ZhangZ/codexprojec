    transitive dependents, and any existing layer violations already
    touching one of them.

    Direct dependents are evidence's own imported_by, unchanged. Transitive
    dependents are a real BFS over that same imported_by edge set (not
    just one hop), capped at _BLAST_RADIUS_MAX_TRANSITIVE with a truncated
    flag rather than silently cut off - a highly-central module (a shared
    utils file) can have far more transitive dependents than are useful to
    return in one call, and the flag says so rather than pretending the
    list is exhaustive.

    With `symbol` given, also confirms which of the direct dependents
    actually CALL it, not just import the file - mirrors
    scan_worker/flash_review.py's build_blast_radius_context exactly: a
    candidate only counts if its real file content contains the symbol
    name in a call-shaped position (`name(`), the same deliberately
    high-confidence-only design (a bare "imports the file" says nothing
    about which of possibly many exported names is actually used).
    Confirmed against real local content via repo_path, not evidence -
    evidence has no per-call-site data to check against.

    Also separately reports `same_file_caller`: whether `target`'s own
    content calls `symbol` from somewhere other than its definition line -
    a same-file/same-class caller (e.g. a class's __call__ invoking one of
    its own other methods) is real and confirmed_callers alone can never
    surface it, since that list only ever checks *other files* that import
    target. Found via a real gap: aletheore_get_blast_radius on Flask's
    wsgi_app returned confirmed_callers=[] (correctly - no other file calls
    it by name) while the actual caller, Flask.__call__, sits one class
    away in the same file. Excludes matches on `symbol`'s own def/class
    line so the symbol's own definition never counts as calling itself.

    layer_violations reports EXISTING violations (evidence's own
    architecture.layer_violations) that already touch a module in this
    blast radius - not a prospective simulation of what a signature change
    would newly break, which would need real symbol-level call resolution
    this scanner doesn't have.
