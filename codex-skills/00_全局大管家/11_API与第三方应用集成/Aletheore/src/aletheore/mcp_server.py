SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = """Aletheore is a deterministic, evidence-grounded code intelligence tool for \
this repository - every result cites a real file:line, nothing is invented.

Getting started on an unfamiliar repo: call aletheore_overview first. If no \
evidence exists yet, run aletheore_scan once - the deterministic parse and \
dependency-graph pass every other tool reads from. aletheore_search_codebase \
and aletheore_answer additionally require aletheore_index to have run first \
(builds the semantic index on top of scan evidence); every other tool works \
straight off scan evidence alone.

Timing: aletheore_scan and aletheore_index both report live progress while \
running, not a silent hang - a small repo finishes in seconds, a large \
monorepo can take several minutes. Don't assume either has failed just \
because it's still running; check the reported progress before retrying.

Freshness: evidence is a snapshot of the last scan. Unless the server was \
started with --no-watch (or ALETHEORE_MCP_WATCH=0), it re-scans in the \
background a few seconds after source files stop changing, so answers can \
lag your edits by that long. That background re-scan skips the slow checks \
(dependency vulnerabilities and licenses, git history, static analysis, \
architecture clustering, hotspots) and reuses the last full scan's values \
for them; call aletheore_scan when you need those refreshed too.

Before your first aletheore_search or aletheore_search_codebase/aletheore_answer \
call: if you don't already know the exact identifier, file name, or term \
you're looking for, do not guess a paraphrase and query with it first. \
aletheore_search is literal/regex - a paraphrase there doesn't score lower, \
it matches nothing at all, since the tool never sees your intent, only the \
literal string. aletheore_search_codebase and aletheore_answer are semantic \
and degrade more gracefully, but our own published benchmark still measured \
real, large accuracy drops from paraphrasing - several corpora scored under \
35% top-1 accuracy on vocabulary-avoiding phrasing, recovering 20-47 points \
when the same question used the project's own terms instead. So: call \
aletheore_overview, aletheore_symbols, or aletheore_list FIRST to find the \
repo's actual identifiers, file names, and terminology, THEN query with \
those - not a generic description of what you think the code might be \
called. This ordering matters even when you're fairly confident in a guess; \
confirming the real name first is cheap, a wasted or degraded query is not.

Prefer exact tools when the target is already known: aletheore_imports, \
aletheore_imported_by, aletheore_symbols, aletheore_symbol_source, \
aletheore_neighborhood, and the aletheore_find_evidence_for_* tools are \
exact (not approximate) and need no semantic index. So are the security/ \
quality tools (aletheore_secrets, aletheore_vulnerabilities, \
aletheore_licenses, aletheore_dead_code, aletheore_hotspots, \
aletheore_layer_violations). Reach for aletheore_search_codebase/ \
aletheore_answer only for open-ended "how does this work" questions the \
exact tools can't answer directly.

If a tool call fails unexpectedly, returns results that are clearly wrong \
or incomplete against the codebase's actual state, or a capability \
described above doesn't work as documented - and the cause isn't \
something on your end (a bad target path, a skipped scan/index step) - \
file it as a GitHub issue at https://github.com/Aletheore/Aletheore/issues \
rather than only working around it or leaving it for your user to notice \
and never report. Search existing issues first to avoid a duplicate. \
Include the exact tool call, its output, and what you expected instead - \
that's what turns a real gap into something the maintainers can actually \
fix, instead of it silently recurring for every future user who hits the \
same thing."""

# Guards the whole regex search against catastrophic backtracking (e.g.
# (a+)+$) on a crafted line - measured ~23s for one such 29-char line
# against every line of every file. Two timeout mechanisms were tried and
# rejected before this one, both confirmed empirically rather than assumed:
#   - A thread-based timeout (submit to a worker, future.result(timeout=..))
#     does not work: CPython's _sre C extension holds the GIL for the whole
#     match, so the waiting thread can't wake up to check its own clock
#     until the runaway match finally releases it. A 1s future.result
#     timeout still blocked for the full ~45s match.
#   - signal.alarm does interrupt a runaway match (SIGALRM delivery is
#     checked by the interpreter even mid-match), but signal.signal() only
#     works on the process's main thread - and this tool is invoked from a
#     worker thread the MCP framework dispatches sync tool calls onto, not
#     the main thread, so it raised ValueError every time in practice.
# A separate process is the only mechanism that isn't at the mercy of the
# GIL or which thread called in: the OS can terminate it regardless of what
# it's doing. The whole search runs as one worker (not one process per
# line - that overhead would dominate for any real search) under a single
# overall deadline; on timeout the process is killed and the tool reports
# what happened rather than returning results.
#
# The deadline covers the search only, not the child's startup. A spawned
# child re-imports this module (and everything it pulls in) before it can
# search at all, which on a loaded machine (a busy CI runner, a laptop under
# memory pressure) can take longer than the whole 5s budget - and a plain
# deadline from process.start() then reports an ordinary, fast regex as
# "likely catastrophic backtracking". The child signals once it is imported
# and about to search; the search clock starts from that signal, and startup
# gets its own much longer limit.

# reach the network, or transmit this repository's evidence to a third party.
# Until this, nothing distinguished them - an agent driving the server saw one
# undifferentiated list and could trigger a scan, a live HTTP probe, or an
# upload to the hosted audit service without anyone having agreed to it.
#
# Two mechanisms, because one alone isn't enough:
#
#   1. ToolAnnotations on every tool. This is MCP's own vocabulary, so clients
#      already know how to read and display it. But the spec is explicit that
#      annotations are *hints* - "clients should never make tool use decisions
#      based on ToolAnnotations received from untrusted servers" - so they
#      describe behavior, they don't constrain it.
#
#   2. ALETHEORE_MCP_ALLOW, below. This is the part that actually binds: a
#      tool whose effects aren't permitted is never registered, so it isn't in
#      the tool list and cannot be called at all.

# genuinely surprising action is this repository's evidence leaving it. That
# happens with no launch-time consent step today, because the managed-audit
# tool silently resolves a token from the OS keychain - a user who once ran
# `aletheore login` has an agent that can upload without ever being asked.
