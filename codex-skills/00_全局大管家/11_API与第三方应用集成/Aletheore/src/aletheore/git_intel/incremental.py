"""Streaming git-log reader and pure aggregation logic for the incremental
repository graph (see graph_store.py for the persisted shape).

The memory-safety property this module exists for: `git log`'s formatted
output for a commit range is read line-by-line via Popen and folded
directly into running aggregates - the raw per-commit text is never held
as a single buffered string or a full in-memory list. Confirmed directly:
the old approach (`subprocess.run(capture_output=True)`) buffering the
entire formatted output was what got OOM-killed scanning torvalds/linux's
1.46M commits under a 1GB memory limit.

A second, independent bound matters just as much for large repos: without
MAX_CO_CHANGE_PARTNERS_TRACKED, the *aggregate* itself (not the raw log
text) is what OOM-kills a cold sync of a repo like torvalds/linux under a
1GB limit - confirmed by reproducing the OOM in a container capped at the
same limit as the production scan-worker, then tracing it to "hub" files
(MAINTAINERS, top-level Kconfig) whose co_change_counts dict grows one
entry per distinct file ever touched alongside them.

# also separates the fields *within* one header line (sha/name/email/date/
# subject) - not just between commits. Real bug found via audit: an earlier
# version used `\x1f` (unit separator) for the intra-line field split, on the
# assumption that a real commit would "vanishingly unlikely" contain a raw
# control byte. That assumption is false - GIT_AUTHOR_NAME accepts arbitrary
# bytes, and a name containing a literal `\x1f` (confirmed directly) shifted
# every field after it: author_email silently became a fragment of the
# author name, the commit's real date landed in the wrong field and failed
# to parse (silently falling back to the 1970 epoch), and the subject came
# out as the real date and subject concatenated - all with no error raised.
# `\x00` doesn't have this problem: it's git's own record-boundary byte and
# genuinely cannot occur inside any of these fields (not "unlikely" - a
# commit's author/committer line and message are built from NUL-terminated
# strings internally, so this is the same guarantee the record separator
# below already depends on, just applied to every field instead of one).
# `%x00` (four literal characters) is git's own pretty-format escape for a
# NUL byte - it belongs in the --format argument. The real `\x00` byte only
# ever appears in git's *output*, never in argv (POSIX forbids embedding a
# raw NUL in an argv string - subprocess correctly rejects that outright).
