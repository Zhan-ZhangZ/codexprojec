"""Backend-agnostic shape for the persistent, incremental repository graph.

Two goals drove this shape:
- Fix the real OOM confirmed on torvalds/linux (1.46M commits, 8.2GB): the
  old approach buffered `git log`'s full formatted output in memory before
  processing anything. The streaming engine (incremental.py) folds each
  commit directly into these aggregates as it reads them, so memory use is
  bounded by the aggregate size (unique files/authors touched), not by
  history size.
- Make repeat scans fast: once a baseline exists, only commits after the
  last-synced SHA need to be read - a normal push's worth, not the whole
  repository - and folded into the existing aggregates rather than
  recomputed from nothing.

Two concrete stores implement RepoGraphStore: SQLiteRepoGraphStore (CLI,
`.aletheore/graph.db`) and PostgresRepoGraphStore (hosted). Both must treat
`apply_commits` as all-or-nothing - a scan that fails partway through must
leave the store exactly as it was before the scan started, so a retry can
always resume cleanly from the last good sync point rather than working
from silently-corrupted aggregates.

    normalized relative to the scan root; a rename line in this commit
    contributes its *new* path to `files` (the old path is not credited a
    separate touch), plus an (old, new) pair in `renames` - fold() uses that
    pair to carry the old path's already-accumulated churn/recent-commits/

    zero (the real audit gap: without this, a just-renamed hot file's
    pre-rename history stayed stranded under a name nothing queries anymore,
    making it look artificially cold).

    `departures` is the narrower, scan-root-crossing sibling of `renames`:
    a rename whose OLD path was in scope but whose NEW path isn't (the file
    moved out of a monorepo subdirectory scan) has nowhere in-scope to
    merge onto, so there's no (old, new) pair to record - but old_path's
