# ratio isn't actually measuring "synthetic repetition" past a certain
# length - it's measuring the value's own alphabet size (a ~64-94
# symbol charset has under 8 bits of entropy per byte, so DEFLATE finds
# real, unavoidable compression headroom in ANY sufficiently long
# string over that alphabet, genuinely random or not - basic
# information theory, not a repetition signal). Measured directly
# (2,000 random trials per length, the same charset generic_credential_
# assignment's value class matches): zero false positives through
# length 60, but real ones start appearing at 64 and grow with length
# (24/2000 by length 76) - exactly the "no real secret should ever
# trip this" guarantee the threshold comment above claims, silently
# violated the moment a value runs past what was actually tested.
# Without this cap, every sufficiently long, genuinely random real
# secret this pattern can match - a JWT, a long API token - was
# misclassified likely_placeholder=True and silently excluded from
# every consumer of that flag (the dashboard, PR comments, MCP tool
# results, CLI/history reporting all filter on it - see cli.py,

# NARROWER real secret alphabet, and hex (0-9a-f, 16 symbols - SHA/MD5
# digests, many session tokens and API keys, git commit-ish tokens) is
# extremely common. A 16-symbol alphabet has under 4 bits of entropy per

# compression headroom in a genuinely random hex string at a MUCH shorter
# length than 48. Measured directly (5,000 random hex trials per length):
# 0% false positives through length 36, but a sharp cliff appears at 41
# (41.2%) and above - not a gradual tail the way the general cutoff has,
# a genuine step change in zlib's own block/table overhead behavior for

# window) was misclassified likely_placeholder=True 82-98% of the time -
