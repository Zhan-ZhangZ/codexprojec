    None for symbols with no parameter list at all (classes, interfaces).

    Every grammar checked (Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, PHP, C#)
    names this field "parameters" directly on the function/method node,
    despite the node TYPE differing (parameters, formal_parameters,
    parameter_list, method_parameters) - confirmed empirically per
    language, not assumed. C/C++ is the one exception: the parameter list
    hangs off a nested function_declarator ("declarator" field) rather
    than the function_definition node directly. Kotlin is a second
    exception, of a different shape: tree-sitter-kotlin names no field on
    function_declaration at all except "name" (confirmed via
    field_name_for_child on every child) - parameters, return type, and
    body are purely positional. The type-name fallback below finds the
    parameter list by its node TYPE instead of a field lookup, which is
    safe to try unconditionally after the field lookup fails: no other
    grammar checked here has a node literally typed
    "function_value_parameters", so this can never accidentally match on
    the wrong grammar. Swift is a third exception, of yet another shape:
    its grammar has no wrapping parameter-list node at all - individual
    `parameter` nodes sit as direct children of function_declaration,
    separated by bare "(", ",", ")" tokens (confirmed empirically) - so
    the span is reconstructed from the outermost "(" and ")" tokens
    themselves rather than read off a single child node.

    Kotlin and Swift's enclosing node TYPE is confirmed identical - both
    grammars literally call it "function_declaration" - so the two
    fallbacks below must not gate on that type name (an earlier merge of
    these two independently-developed fallbacks did exactly that, which
    would have silently broken Kotlin's params by always taking Swift's
    branch first and returning early). Ordered by trying each fallback's
    own node shape in turn instead: Kotlin's function_value_parameters
    child is looked for first (absent on a Swift node, so harmless there),
    and only if that comes up empty does the bare "(...)" token scan run.

    "export function f() {}" nests function_declaration inside
    export_statement, and the comment sits before export_statement, not
    before the nested function_declaration. Java has no such wrapper (a
    method_declaration's own prev_sibling is the block_comment directly,
    also confirmed empirically) but checking the parent too is harmless
    there since it simply won't match.

    `comment_type` differs per grammar - JS/TS calls every comment
    "comment" and distinguishes "/** */" from "//" only by text; Java's
    grammar gives block comments their own node type, "block_comment",
    entirely separate from line comments.

    Any matching-type comment node is accepted whose raw text starts with
    `marker`, so a plain "// line comment" is correctly treated as not a
    doc comment.
