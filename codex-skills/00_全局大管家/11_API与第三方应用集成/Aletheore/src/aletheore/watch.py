"""`aletheore watch` - keep evidence and the search index current while you work.

A scan is only true at the moment it ran. Between scans, every consumer -
`query`, the MCP server an agent is driving, the dashboard - is answering
from a snapshot of a repository that has since moved. This closes that gap
without asking anyone to remember a command.

Why OS file events rather than polling: measured on this repository, walking
and stat-ing the tree costs 841 ms for 644 files. A two-second poll would
burn roughly 40% of a core, continuously, on a laptop that is also running a
compiler and an editor - and worse on a monorepo. watchdog uses FSEvents on
macOS and inotify on Linux, so idle cost is essentially zero and cost scales
with edits rather than repository size.
