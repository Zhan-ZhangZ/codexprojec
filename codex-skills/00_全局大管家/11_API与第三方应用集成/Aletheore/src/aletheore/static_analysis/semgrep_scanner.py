# full-scan pass against a genuinely monorepo-scale Go repo
# (grafana/grafana) - the same "fast on a moderate repo, not fast on a
# huge one" gap already found and fixed for Bearer. Scaled the same way,
# generously over the one real rate this package has measured (~3.8ms/file
# at 3331 files/12.8s) rather than a tight fit to it - Semgrep is on by
# default (unlike Bearer/Joern), so under-scaling here silently degrades
