# Semgrep/gosec/Bandit/Trivy are stateless CLI subprocess calls with no
# infra dependency and bounded, predictable runtime - real value
# demonstrated live (docs/audits/deterministic_scanner_evaluation.md), on
# by default the same way dependency_vulnerabilities/dependency_licenses
# already are. Trivy specifically real-timed on this repo before being
# added here, not assumed safe by category alone (2026-09-21): 3.15s on
# the github-app/ subtree (241 files), 10.46s on the real full ~3,331-file
# tree - well-scaling, not the pathological blowup Bearer's own real
# timing showed at the same jump (18.7s -> 300s+). Caught a real, live
# OpenAI API key in this repo's own .env that secrets.py has zero pattern
# coverage for (confirmed: grep -i openai src/aletheore/secrets.py matches
# nothing), and real Dockerfile misconfigurations detect_infrastructure
# structurally cannot produce (pure file-inventory, no misconfig
# analysis) - real, demonstrated value, not just a plausible addition.
# PMD is the same real-timed-first-then-decided addition (2026-09-21):
# 2.74s on google/gson (264 real Java files), 5.0s on apache/commons-lang
# (629 files) - well-scaling, no JVM-startup-blowup problem. Its default
# bestpractices+errorprone+security ruleset combo was NOT trustworthy
# as-is though: unfiltered against gson it produced 3,582 violations, 70%
# of them two JUnit-authoring-convention rules (WrongTestAnnotation,
# UnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts) flagging test-code style, not bugs, and
# CloseResource (a real bug-class rule in principle) sampled as a real
# false positive on the same repo (flagged a JsonTreeWriter - an in-memory
# tree builder whose close() is a no-op, not a real I/O resource). See
# pmd_scanner.py's _NOISY_RULES for the full, evidence-based exclude list -
# the remaining ~271 findings on that same repo were spot-checked as
# bug-shaped before trusting them.
# Bearer, Joern, and SonarQube are each opt-in, for different real reasons
# found live: SonarQube per the integration scope doc's hosting-cost
# tradeoff; Bearer because its full-repo runtime doesn't scale cleanly
# with repo size (18.7s on a 241-file subtree, still running past 300s on
# this repo's real ~3,331-file tree); Joern because a CPG build is real
# JVM-startup-plus-parsing cost (several real seconds even for one
# mid-sized package) and requires a whole separate toolchain most installs
# won't have. See cli.py's interactive ask-and-warn prompt for how Bearer
# specifically is opted into; Joern and SonarQube are flag/env-var opt-in
# without a prompt, since neither is likely to be installed/configured by
# default at all.
