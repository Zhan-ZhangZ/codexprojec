# Real noise found live testing this against gson (264 real Java files,
# 2026-09-21): the unfiltered bestpractices+errorprone+security combo
# produced 3,582 violations, 70% of them two JUnit-authoring-convention
# rules (WrongTestAnnotation, UnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts) that flag
# test-code style, not bugs. The remaining ruleset (271 findings on the
# same repo) is bug-shaped: AssignmentInOperand, NullAssignment,
# AvoidCatchingGenericException, CompareObjectsWithEquals, and similar,
# each spot-checked against real source before trusting it.
#
# CloseResource was excluded here too at first, on a single sampled false
# positive on this same repo (Gson.java:545 flags a JsonTreeWriter, an
# in-memory tree builder whose close() is a no-op, not a real I/O
# resource PMD's heuristic can't tell apart from one that is) - but
# blanket-silencing a real bug-class rule for every repo because of one
# unrelated open-source sample meant a genuine unclosed file/socket/
# stream leak in ANY repo scanned through this pipeline would never be
# flagged at all. Re-enabled: an occasional in-memory-writer false
# positive is the right trade-off against losing the whole rule.
