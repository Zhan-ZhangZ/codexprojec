# Real finding (2026-09-23, stress-testing the scanner integration against
# real repos): unfiltered against pallets/flask (a clean, well-regarded
# codebase), B101 alone was 1,054 of 1,083 total Bandit findings (97%) -
# fires on every bare `assert` statement, and Python code idiomatically
# uses `assert` constantly (96% of these were in tests/ and examples/,
# pytest's own idiom; the handful in real src/ were ordinary programmer-
# error sanity checks, e.g. `assert bool(static_host) == host_matching,
# "Invalid ..."` - not security-critical logic gated on assert). Same
# noise class PMD's own _NOISY_RULES already excludes for a different
# tool (WrongTestAnnotation/UnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts flagging test-
# authoring convention, not bugs) - same evidence-based treatment here.

# Real false positive found live (2026-09-28, PR #858): Bandit's own B608
# check (bandit/plugins/injection_sql.py) flagged frontend.py's WIKI_HTML -
# a huge f-string building the AIRview page's HTML/JS, no SQL involved
# anywhere in this module - as "Possible SQL injection vector through
# string-based query construction." Traced to Bandit's own SIMPLE_SQL_RE:
# it pairs "update\s" with a LATER "set\s" using an UNBOUNDED `.*` under
# re.DOTALL, so it happily bridges thousands of characters of unrelated
# JS/HTML between them. The real match on that file: the word "update" in
# a code comment ("a later incremental update broke, not the first
# build"), paired ~5,700 characters later with the trailing whitespace
# after the JS identifier "nodeSet" (`const nodeSet = ...`) - "Set "
# satisfies `set\s` case-insensitively. Neither word has anything to do
# with the other or with SQL; a real SQL statement built this way (even
# split across several `+`-joined lines) never puts its own keyword pair
# more than a couple hundred characters apart.
#
# Re-verified against the real AST rather than patching Bandit's own
# installed regex (a vendored third-party tool, not this codebase) - see
# _sql_injection_is_plausible below. Only test_id "B608" goes through this
# extra check; every other Bandit rule is trusted as before.
#
# Bound raised from 300 to 1,500 (2026-10-03, backward-audit finding): a
# real INSERT/UPDATE against a wide table (dozens of columns) can legitimately
# put a couple hundred characters between its keyword pair, which 300 was
# cutting off as a false negative - see _sql_injection_is_plausible's
# "assign the query, execute it later" gap below for the matching failure
# mode. 1,500 stays far short of the real false positive this bound exists
# to catch (~5,700 unrelated characters, see above) - test_bandit_scanner.py's
# own _WIKI_LIKE_FALSE_POSITIVE_SOURCE fixture (2,750 characters of filler)
# is a closer, still-safe tripwire for that regression.
