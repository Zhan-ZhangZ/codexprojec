# 180s (this package's original default) timed out on every real
# full-scan pass against a genuinely monorepo-scale Go repo
# (grafana/grafana) - the same gap already found and fixed for Bearer,
# then Semgrep. gosec's own real bottleneck is likely module/dependency
# graph resolution (it type-checks via go/importer), not raw file count,
# so file count is a weaker proxy here than it is for Semgrep/Bearer -
# no better one is available without more real data, so this uses the
# same conservative base+per-file+ceiling shape rather than leaving the
# flat timeout that's already confirmed insufficient.
