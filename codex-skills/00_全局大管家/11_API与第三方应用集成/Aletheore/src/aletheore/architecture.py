    """Group dependency_graph's modules into communities by import density.

    Test files are excluded before clustering, not after: they pollute
    architecture grouping the same way they polluted retrieval accuracy
    (see search_index._is_test_path's own measurement). Reproduced directly
    on AutoMapper/AutoMapper - 420 of 513 dependency-graph nodes (82%) are
    test files, and clustering them alongside real source produced 119
    subsystems for 512 files instead of a handful of meaningful ones,
    because modularity clustering has no notion of "this node doesn't count
    toward the architecture" - every test file becomes its own small
    community or drags a real one apart. Every consumer of these clusters
    (AIRview subsystems, the dashboard's dependency graph, aletheore_cluster)
    wants architecture, not a test suite's own internal structure.

    extra_edges: supplementary relations that are real but were never going
    to appear in a literal import graph - currently Rails model-to-model
    associations (see model_associations.rails_model_association_edges).
    Confirmed real, not hypothetical: a real Discourse scan (app/models +
    db, 3,051 files) produced 3,044 clusters from the import graph alone -
    almost exactly one cluster per file - because ActiveRecord associations
    (`belongs_to`, `has_many`) are declarative, never a literal Ruby
    require/import, so two obviously-related models (Post and User) share
    no import edge at all. These only influence which community a node
    joins - they are deliberately kept out of `edges` below (and so out of
    internal_edges/cross_cluster_edges), which report only real import
    density and must not silently start counting relations that aren't
    imports at all.
