"""Per-file results cache shared by the scan stages that work file by file.

A re-scan of an unchanged repo used to redo every per-file stage from scratch
(on the Linux kernel: ~50s of secrets, ~30s of error handling, ~25s of line
counting). This stores each stage's result for each file keyed by the file's
content hash, so the next scan only does the files that changed.

Safety rules, the same ones scan-cache.json follows:

- Content hash, not mtime: a branch switch that touches mtimes without
  changing bytes is a hit, an edit that keeps the mtime is a miss.
- Every entry is stamped with the scanner's version *and* a hash of the source
  module that produced it, so changing the scanner (even in an editable
  install where __version__ doesn't move) invalidates its old results.
- Off under ALETHEORE_DISABLE_LOCAL_SCAN_CACHE (the hosted worker): a hosted
  checkout is someone else's repo, and they could commit a cache file that
  hides their own findings. ALETHEORE_FILE_CACHE_PATH can point a trusted
  caller (one that owns the file, outside the checkout) at its own database,
  one per repo: entries are keyed by repo-relative path, and each scan drops
  the rows for paths it didn't see, so two repos sharing a database would
  keep evicting each other (never wrong results, since hits need a matching
  content hash, just no reuse).

# is None). That excludes the hosted worker: its scans run in a subprocess with
# ALETHEORE_DISABLE_LOCAL_SCAN_CACHE set (scan_worker/jobs.py). The real case is
# a long-lived local process such as the MCP server, which would otherwise
# accumulate an entry for every path it ever scans across changing checkouts. Its
# legitimate reuse (one repo, stable paths, re-stat'd on repeat scans) is
# unaffected while that repo's file count stays under the cap.
