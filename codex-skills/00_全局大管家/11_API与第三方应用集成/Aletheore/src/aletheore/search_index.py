# embedded thrift (the largest corpus benchmarked, 13,444 chunks) in 754.7s
# versus nomic's 828.6s - 9% faster, not slower, despite being the "heavier"
# model. It also carries the retrieval-quality edge already established for
# jina over nomic (+3.9pp top-1 mean, see the embedding-model-comparison
# work), and Q8_0 is a high-fidelity quantization, not the aggressive kind
# that would give that edge back. No real downside found: both are 768-dim,
# so the switch is a routine embedder-identity change the existing

    Started detached so it outlives this specific command rather than

    "Detached" means something different per platform, both applied here:
    on POSIX, `start_new_session=True` puts the child in its own process
    group and session, so it is not a child of this process in any way
    the OS would clean up together. On Windows, `start_new_session` does
    not exist - the equivalent is `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` (so the
    child does not receive a Ctrl+C/console-close event sent to this
    process's console, which would otherwise kill it right along with
    Aletheore) combined with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (ollama.exe is a console-
    subsystem binary; without this it would flash a new console window

    old and new dimensions happen to match (see IndexDimensionMismatchError:
    Ollama's nomic-embed-text and the hosted jina-embeddings-v2-base-code
    both embed to 768 dimensions from unrelated vector spaces, so dimension
    alone cannot tell them apart).

    False unless the operator has explicitly permitted EFFECT_EXTERNAL (see

    Equal weight. Weighting full-text higher was measured and helps the repo
    whose questions use its own public vocabulary while hurting the one
    whose answers live in prose, so there is no weighting that is right for
    both - and the caller does not know which kind of repo they have.
