"""ORM-native migration parsing: Django, Rails, and Alembic.

`schema_map.py`'s `extract_schema` only ever reads raw `.sql` files. Django
migrations are `.py`, Rails migrations are `.rb`, Alembic migrations are
`.py` too - none of them are `.sql`, so a repository using any of these
three (all three are explicitly recognized ORMs in `scanner/detect.py`'s
`DB_ORM_MARKERS_PY`, and their migration directories are hardcoded special
cases in `_detect_migration_directories`) previously produced a schema
that silently looked identical to "no schema at all."

This module produces the same event shapes `schema_map.py`'s replay loop
already merges (`create_table` / `add_column` / `create_index` /
`remove_column` / `alter_column` / `rename_column` / `remove_table` /
`rename_table` / `remove_index` / `raw_sql` / `unsupported`), but
pre-built rather than raw SQL text - each ORM's own call syntax is walked
directly with tree-sitter rather than routed through the SQL tokenizer,
since none of these three is SQL. The one exception is `raw_sql`: Django's
`RunSQL`, Alembic's `op.execute`, and Rails' `execute` all accept a literal
SQL string, which is handed to schema_map.py's own Postgres parser and
replayed exactly like a real `.sql` file's statement - not re-implemented
here.

Scope, deliberately narrower than each framework's full DSL, mirroring
schema_map.py's own restraint: model every operation with a clear,
unambiguous DDL meaning; record anything else as `unsupported` rather
than guess. What's still `unsupported`, and why each one specifically:

- Django: `RunPython` (arbitrary code - not statically modelable) is
  recorded, not modeled. Every other operation this module doesn't
  explicitly model - the legacy `AlterModelOptions`/`AlterUniqueTogether`/
  `AlterModelTable` APIs (superseded by `Meta.constraints`/per-field
  `db_column`) as well as newer ones like `AddConstraint`/
  `RemoveConstraint`/`AlterIndexTogether`/`AlterOrderWithRespectTo`/
  `SeparateDatabaseAndState` - is caught by a catch-all and recorded as
  `unsupported` too, rather than silently dropped; `ManyToManyField` (an
  implicit through-table this module does not construct) likewise falls
  through to that catch-all. Everything else - `CreateModel`, `AddField`,
  `RemoveField`, `AlterField`, `RenameField`, `DeleteModel`, `RenameModel`,
  `AddIndex`, `RemoveIndex`, `RunSQL` - is modeled, including the implicit
  `id` primary key Django adds when no field is marked `primary_key=True`.
  Table names follow Django's default `<app_label>_<model>` convention
  (app_label taken from the migration file's own app directory); an
  explicit `Meta.db_table` override on `CreateModel` itself is not read.
- Rails: `create_join_table` (the implicit join-table name follows a
  real but fiddlier alphabetical-pluralization rule not worth the added
  surface) and `remove_foreign_key` (relations are not individually
  addressable for removal without risking dropping the wrong one when a
  table has more than one FK to the same target) are recorded, not
  modeled. Everything else - `create_table`/`change_table` blocks,
  `t.<type>`/`t.references`/`t.belongs_to`/`t.timestamps`, standalone
  `add_column`/`remove_column`/`rename_column`/`change_column`/
  `change_column_null`/`change_column_default`/`add_index`/`remove_index`/
  `add_foreign_key`/`add_reference`/`add_belongs_to`/`drop_table`/
  `rename_table`/`execute` - is modeled. Any Ruby method call that isn't a
  recognized Rails migration DSL method (`_RAILS_KNOWN_METHODS`) is
  silently ignored rather than flagged, so a seed-data helper or a
  `reversible`/`say` wrapper doesn't drown real findings in noise.
  Pluralization (for `references`'/`belongs_to`'s/`add_reference`'s
  implied target table) is a simple regular-noun heuristic, not a full
  inflector - irregular plurals (`person` -> `people`) resolve wrong.
- Alembic: `op.drop_constraint`/`op.create_check_constraint`/
  `op.create_unique_constraint`/`op.create_primary_key` (constraint
  identity is not tracked precisely enough on relations/columns to
  resolve which one is affected) are recorded, not modeled - both as
  top-level `op.*` calls and as `batch_op.*` calls inside a `with
  op.batch_alter_table(table) as batch_op:` block (the standard pattern
  for SQLite, which can't do most `ALTER TABLE` directly - `batch_op`'s
  methods have the same argument shape as their `op.*` counterparts minus
  the table name, implied by the enclosing `with`). Every other operation
  this module doesn't explicitly model, at either call shape, is likewise
  caught by a catch-all and recorded as `unsupported` rather than
  silently dropped - except `op.f(...)`/`op.get_bind()`/`op.get_context()`/
  `op.inline_literal(...)`, real Alembic calls with no DDL meaning of
  their own (naming-convention/introspection helpers), which are ignored
  entirely rather than flagged, matching how an unrecognized Rails DSL
  call is ignored rather than flagged. Everything else - `op.create_table`,
  `op.add_column`, `op.create_index`, `op.create_foreign_key` (plus an
  inline `sa.ForeignKey(...)`/`sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(...)` inside
  either), `op.drop_table`, `op.drop_column`, `op.alter_column`,
  `op.drop_index`, `op.rename_table`, `op.execute` - is modeled, at both
  call shapes. Only statements inside `def upgrade():` are read;
  `downgrade()` is ignored. Alembic orders migrations via each file's own
  `revision`/`down_revision` chain, not filename - this module does not
  resolve that graph and instead sorts files by path like every other
  migration source, which is a known, documented approximation, not the
  guaranteed real replay order.

    """One Rails migration file's real DDL events, from its raw source
    bytes - the single-file primitive extract_rails_migrations' directory
    scan is built on, also used directly by Flash Review to parse just a
    diff's changed migration file without needing it on a real local
    checkout (see scan_worker/flash_review.py's schema/endpoint context).

    Older Rails migrations (real, common in any app with years of
    history - found via a real Discourse migration from 2012) use a
    separate `def up` / `def down` pair instead of one reversible `def
    change`. `down` is rollback-only code, never applied by a real
    deploy, and must not be walked: found via that same real file
    (20120423151548_remove_last_post_id.rb, `up` removes a column,
    `down` adds it back) - without this exclusion, the down method's
    add_column was read right alongside up's remove_column, as if the
    migration both removed and re-added the same column.

    The same rollback-only shape also appears inside one `change` method
    as `reversible do |dir|; dir.up { ... }; dir.down { ... }; end` - a
    `call` node named "down" (receiver `dir`), not a `method` node, so it
    needs its own exclusion below. Without it, `dir.down`'s block was
    walked right alongside `dir.up`'s, fabricating a forward-migration
    event from code that only runs on rollback - worse than the `def
    down` case, since here it's silent even in a `def change` migration
    that never uses the separate-methods form at all.

    The exclusion is scoped to receivers bound by an actual `reversible`
    block parameter in this file (see `_rails_reversible_dir_names`) -
    matching every `<anything>.down { ... }` call by method name alone
    would also silently drop unrelated forward-migration code that
    happens to call a `.down` method on some other receiver.
