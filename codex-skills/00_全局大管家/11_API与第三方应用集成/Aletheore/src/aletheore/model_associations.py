"""Rails model-to-model relation edges, derived directly from each model
file's own belongs_to/has_one/has_many/has_and_belongs_to_many
declarations - not from schema/migrations at all.

Why this exists: architecture.py's build_clusters groups files by import-
graph density (networkx greedy_modularity_communities), which only sees
edges from real import/require statements. A Rails model relates to
another model through a declarative ActiveRecord association
(`belongs_to :user`), never a literal `require` - so two files whose
tables share a real, obvious foreign-key relationship (Post belongs_to
User) produce zero edges in the import graph and cluster as unrelated
singletons. Confirmed real, not hypothetical: a real Discourse scan
(app/models + db, 382 files) produced near-one-cluster-per-file before
this module existed, because Rails models barely reference each other
via Ruby require/import at all, even though they are obviously related.

Scope, deliberately narrow, matching orm_migrations.py's own restraint:
- A file's class counts as a model if it inherits ActiveRecord::Base or
  ApplicationRecord directly, or transitively through a chain of other
  classes defined among this same set of files (e.g. a real Discourse
  case: ReviewablePost < Reviewable < ActiveRecord::Base) - the chain is
  walked with a cycle guard, and a superclass that isn't itself one of
  these files' own classes stops the walk rather than guessing whether it
  ultimately reaches ActiveRecord::Base.
- The class definition itself may be wrapped in one or more `module`
  blocks (namespaced models, e.g. `module Admin; class User < AR::Base;
  end; end` - a real, common Rails pattern) - resolution still keys on
  the class's own short name, same as an unwrapped class, so two
  namespaced models sharing a short name (`Admin::User` vs `Api::User`)
  are as best-effort-resolved as two unnamespaced files already were.
- Only belongs_to/has_one/has_many/has_and_belongs_to_many are read; any
  other method call is ignored.
- An explicit class_name: option always wins over the naming convention.
- A polymorphic belongs_to (polymorphic: true) or a has_many/has_one with
  as: (also polymorphic) is skipped - the association's real target
  varies row by row, not one fixed model, so there is no single file to
  point an edge at.
- A :through association is skipped - its real target is a second-degree
  relation via the through model, not something this file's own
  association name resolves to directly, and resolving it correctly
  needs the through model's own associations too, not just this file's.
- Naming-convention resolution (when there is no explicit class_name:)
  reuses orm_migrations.py's own _pluralize heuristic (regular nouns
  only - irregular plurals like person/people resolve wrong) rather than
  adding a second, differently-imperfect inflector, and only ever
  resolves against class names actually found among this scan's own
  model files - never a guessed file that may not exist.
