"""Checks that generated prose points at places that really exist.

There are three levels of grounding in this codebase, in increasing
strength. Everything that reports a "verified" claim to a customer should
be explicit about which one it actually applied - reporting a level you
didn't reach is the same defect as not checking at all.

1. FILE EXISTS - the cited path is in the scan's file inventory. Always
   available, since AIR always lists the files it parsed. On its own this
   catches invented filenames and nothing else: a citation naming a real
   file at a completely fabricated line passes.
2. LINE IN BOUNDS - additionally, the cited line is within that file's
   real length. Needs a `fetch_line_count`, because AIR does not record
   per-file line counts. Callers that hold a real checkout (the managed
   audit) get this for free; callers that would have to re-fetch file
   contents over the network (AIRview) may not always have it. This
   result reports `line_bounds_checked` so a caller can state honestly
   how many citations actually reached this level.
3. CONTENT MATCHES - additionally, text the claim quotes verbatim appears
   near the cited line. Strongest, but only meaningful where the claim is
   structured enough to attach quotes to a single location, so it lives
   in flash_review.py's _line_citation_content_matches (per-finding,
   against a diff) rather than here (whole-document prose).

Level 3 is not a stricter version of this function that someone forgot to
write: it needs a different input shape. What matters is that each
surface says which level it reached.
