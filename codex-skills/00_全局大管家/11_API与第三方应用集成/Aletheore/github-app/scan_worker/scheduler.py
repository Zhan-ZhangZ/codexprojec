HEALTH_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 180
# The sweep pings every endpoint for every repo for every monitored
# installation, serially, each bounded to 5s by run_healthcheck's own
# per-request timeout. 600s is a deliberate ceiling well above normal
# runtime that still guarantees the job can't run forever and pile up
# against the next scheduler tick indefinitely.
HEALTH_SWEEP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 600
# A single indexed DELETE against a small table - generous but bounded.
SESSION_CLEANUP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60
# Same shape as the session cleanup: one range DELETE over an index on
# webhook_deliveries.received_at. Runs on every tick, which is far more
# often than a 30-day retention window needs, but it costs a no-op query
# and means the table can never quietly grow unbounded if the scheduler
# spends a long stretch restarting.
WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_CLEANUP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60
# Local orphaned per-job repo clones live under scan_worker.jobs.JOBS_ROOT
# and can survive worker SIGKILLs; this is a bounded age-based filesystem
# sweep over direct children only.
JOB_TEMP_DIR_CLEANUP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60
ENDPOINT_HEALTH_CLEANUP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60

# DELETE over an index on evidence_packet_cache.created_at.
EVIDENCE_PACKET_CACHE_CLEANUP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60
# One indexed SELECT plus, for the rare stale row, one UPDATE (release) and
# one DELETE per row - bounded the same way the other sub-minute sweeps here
# are, since a stale reservation row (one process's hard-kill leak) is a
# rare event, not a per-tick norm.
LLM_SPEND_RESERVATION_SWEEP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60
# The sweep itself only calls run_live_docs_full_build_job for repos that
# list_paid_repos_due_for_docs_catchup already filtered to "genuinely due"
# (48h+ since last sweep, real activity since then) - most ticks this
# enqueues, checks the due list, and finds nothing to do. Bounded well
# above normal runtime for the rare tick where several repos are due at
# once, same reasoning as HEALTH_SWEEP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS.
#
# Raised from 600 to match LIVE_WIKI_FULL_BUILD_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS's own
# 1800: MAX_DOCS_FULL_BUILD_FILES/MAX_WIKI_FULL_BUILD_CLUSTERS now scale a
# single full-build call up to a real repo's own size (capped at 200, up
# from the old flat 50) rather than a small fixed batch - measured
# directly against a real 857-cluster repo, a single 50-cluster batch
# alone already took over 600s wall-clock, so the old ceiling was already
# tight before this change and would silently truncate a due repo's
# progress for a whole 48h cycle if left as-is.
DOCS_CATCHUP_SWEEP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 1800
# Same reasoning as DOCS_CATCHUP_SWEEP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS - run_live_wiki_
# catchup_sweep_job only calls run_live_wiki_full_build_job for repos
# list_paid_repos_due_for_wiki_catchup already filtered to genuinely due.
WIKI_CATCHUP_SWEEP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 1800
# Reads the due list (a cheap join over installations/digest_sends), then
# enqueues one send per recipient onto "email" rather than sending inline -
# the actual Resend calls happen there, not in this job, so this stays
# bounded even if many installations are due the same tick.
WEEKLY_DIGEST_SWEEP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 300
# Same bounded shape as ENDPOINT_HEALTH_CLEANUP_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, hence
# the same 60s: one indexed query over installations_next_monthly_credit_
# reset_at (migration 065's partial index, which only contains the handful
# of annual subscribers at all) plus, for the rare installation actually
# due, a couple of single-row reads and one single-row UPDATE. Most ticks
# find nothing due and do no work beyond that one query.
MONTHLY_CREDIT_RESET_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60
# A single max(checked_at) query plus, on the rare stale tick, one email -
# nothing here can run long.
HEALTH_SWEEP_STALENESS_CHECK_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60

SCANS_QUEUE_NAME = "scans"
# The health sweep gets its own queue, consumed by a dedicated worker (see
# health_worker.py), instead of sharing "scans" with push-triggered Flash
# reviews, AIRview builds, and managed audits. Those are real LLM calls
# that can run for minutes; on a single shared queue, one long job delays
# every health sweep enqueued behind it - observed live in prod, where one
# Flash review run backed up three consecutive sweep ticks. Endpoint
# monitoring needs to keep running on its own ~3-minute cadence regardless
# of what the AI job queue is doing, especially now that the public status
# API drops any endpoint not checked in the last 15 minutes.
