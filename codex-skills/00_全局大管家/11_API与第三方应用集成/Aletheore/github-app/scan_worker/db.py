    Two deliberate choices here:

    (a) next_monthly_credit_reset_at advances by one month past ITS OWN
    PREVIOUS VALUE, not past now(). The scheduler ticks about every three
    minutes and the sweep runs behind whatever else is on the "scans"
    queue, so a due date is always caught some minutes - occasionally
    hours - late. Anchoring the next date on now() would bake each of
    those delays into the schedule permanently, walking the reset day
    later and later through the year; anchoring it on the previous due
    date keeps it fixed to the calendar no matter how late any individual
    tick lands.

    (b) balance_epoch is incremented, exactly as a real renewal reset
    does. That is the actual reset mechanism for the low-balance/
    exhausted credit emails - they are deduped through sent_emails on
    f"credit_low_balance:{installation_id}:{balance_epoch}" (see
    reserve_llm_spend_with_email_hooks in jobs.py), there are no
    per-installation "email sent" timestamp columns to clear. Without the
    increment, a customer warned in month three would never be warned
    again for the rest of the year, because every later month would reuse
    that month's dedupe key.

    Idempotent per due date rather than per call: the WHERE clause
    re-checks that the row is still actually due, so a second sweep in
    the same tick window (or a retried RQ job) finds the date already
    advanced past now() and changes nothing.

    """Serializes one repo's Live Wiki writes across whichever job reaches
    it: a full build, an incremental push-triggered update, and an
    incremental PR-triggered update can all be enqueued for the same repo
    close together, on different scan-worker replicas, and none of that
    concurrency is bounded by repo_checkout_lock - that lock's scope ends
    (checkout releases) before the wiki job is even enqueued.

    Guards two separate functions in scan_worker.jobs, not the slower LLM
    generation that runs before either: _store_wiki_subsystem_records (the
    upsert/prune step) and _regenerate_wiki_overview (the overview
    read-and-regenerate step). NEITHER function acquires this lock
    itself - the caller must hold it across every call in one logical
    write, and callers get this wrong at their peril: an earlier version
    of this split gave each function its own separate acquisition, which
    let a concurrent job's complete write land in the gap between one
    job's own prune and its own later overview read, corrupting exactly
    the invariant described below (found via independent audit, not
    theoretical - confirmed by reading the pre-fix code directly).
    _store_wiki_generation (the incremental-update path) holds one
    acquisition across both calls. run_live_wiki_full_build_job holds a
    separate acquisition per chunk's store call (so a concurrent job for
    the same repo isn't made to wait out this job's entire multi-chunk
    run just to get a turn), except the LAST chunk, whose store call
    shares one continuous acquisition with the following overview call -
    the only pairing that actually needs to be gapless, since every
    chunk within one job shares that job's own single evidence snapshot
    and the race below was never about this job's own writes racing each
    other, only about two DIFFERENT jobs' evidence snapshots racing.

    Real bug this closes: the upsert/prune step prunes wiki_subsystems
    rows using ITS OWN evidence snapshot's current cluster list
    (delete_wiki_subsystems_not_in) - if an older-evidence job's write
    lands after a newer-evidence job's (e.g. two pushes close together,
    finishing out of order), the older job's prune step has no way to
    know about a cluster the newer evidence already added, and deletes
    that just-written, still-current subsystem row out from under it.

    Deliberately blocking, same reasoning as repo_checkout_lock: a second
    wiki write for the same repo should wait its turn and still run, not
    fail fast and silently drop a real update. A distinct namespace from
    repo_checkout_lock (see WIKI_WRITE_LOCK_NAMESPACE) - these are two
    independent resources for the same repo, and coupling them would make
    a slow AI-writing job needlessly block an unrelated checkout, or vice
    versa.
