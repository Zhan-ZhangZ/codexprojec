"""AIRview generation: naming, writing, and evidence-grounding on top of
the deterministic briefs/diagrams in aletheore.wiki_mapping/wiki_diagrams.

Naming always uses Flash - cheap, fast, low-stakes (just picking a
readable label for a cluster the scanner already found). Writing uses
the pricing tier's model (see scan_worker/model_tiers.py) for the
one-time initial build, and Flash for every incremental update after
that regardless of tier - frequent, on every push, so it stays cheap
even for higher tiers. Both use this module's same functions - which
adapter to pass in is the caller's decision (see jobs.py).

Every model response is validated against the deterministic brief it was
given before being trusted: a file, function, or line number the model
returns that isn't actually in the brief is dropped, never stored. This
module never touches the database - it takes evidence and adapters in,
returns plain dict records out. Optional cache callables can be injected
by the caller, but this module never imports a cache or database client.

The description must be 4-8 sentences and must cover, in this order:
1. What this subsystem does.
2. WHY it exists as a separate unit - the design problem it solves. This is the most valuable

file, function, or line number.

in the repository, including ones in `related_files`, using `path/to/file.py:123` citations -

`repo_context`: repo-wide facts from other scanners (database schema, API endpoints, dependency
vulnerabilities/licenses, dead code, infrastructure, environment variables) - see the "How it
works"/"Gotchas" guidance below for when to use it. Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{"detail": "<markdown, 250-400 words>"}

Structure the markdown with these headings, in order:

## Overview
What this file is responsible for, in two or three sentences.

## Why it exists
The design problem this file solves and why it is a separate file. If the answer is visible in the
code - a separation of concerns, a protocol boundary, a compatibility shim - say so specifically.
Skip this heading only if the file is a trivial re-export.

## How it works
The main flow through the file, naming concrete symbols and citing them as `path:line`. This is
where a reader learns the mechanism, so prefer specifics over restating names.

## Key symbols
A short bulleted list: `` `name` (path:line) `` followed by what it does and when it runs.

## Gotchas
Anything surprising a reader would otherwise trip on - ordering constraints, mutation,
deprecations. If `repo_context` shows this file defines a route in `api_endpoints`, maps to a
`database_schema` table, or touches a flagged dependency/vulnerability, that belongs here or in
"How it works" - only when genuinely relevant to this specific file, never forced in. Omit this
heading if the code shows nothing surprising; do not invent one.

Prefer depth over breadth within each heading: a reader who opens a file page wants the
mechanism, not a restatement of the symbol list they can already see.

Cite as `path/to/file.py:123`, using only line numbers you were given. You may cite the imported
and importing files, not just this one - use `related_symbols` for those, it is the only source of
real line numbers outside this file. Three kinds of entry inside `repo_context` carry a real,
citable `file`/`line` and may be cited the same way: `database_schema.tables` (where the table
itself was created), `database_schema.relations` (each foreign-key relation), and `api_endpoints`
(each HTTP route). Every other field in `repo_context` - vulnerabilities, licenses, dead code,
infrastructure, environment variables - has NO file or line attached. You may mention one of these
by name in prose, but NEVER write a `path:line` citation for one - there is no real location to
cite, and a fabricated one fails verification and discards the whole page. A cross-file
citation using a name or line not present there will fail verification, so do not guess at a
related file's internals beyond what it lists. Every
citation is checked against the scan and the page is discarded if any citation does not resolve.

you cannot see. No markdown fences around the whole response."""

You are given a JSON array of subsystem items, each with an "id" (echo this back exactly as the
key in your response - never invent your own id), "name", a "brief" listing its files and each
file's key functions/classes with line numbers, and a "related_files" list naming files elsewhere
in the repository that this subsystem imports or is imported by.

An item may also carry a "skip_files" list - paths from that item's own brief that already have an
up-to-date page and were not changed. Omit those paths from that item's "files" array entirely; do
not write role or key_symbols entries for them, even though they still appear in the brief for your
own context. Write full entries only for that item's brief files NOT in its own "skip_files". If an
item has no "skip_files" or it is empty, write every file in that item's brief as before. Never use
one item's "skip_files" for a different item.

Respond with ONLY a single JSON object with one entry per item you were given, keyed by that
item's "id" (as a string): {"<id>": {"description": "<see below>", "files": [{"path": "<exact
path from that item's brief>", "role": "2-3 sentences on this file's responsibility and how it
fits the subsystem", "key_symbols": [{"name": "<exact name from that item's brief>", "line":
<exact start_line from that item's brief>, "explanation": "1-2 sentences on what it does and when
it runs"}]}]}, "<id>": {...}, ...}

Each item's "description" must be 4-8 sentences and must cover, in this order:
1. What this subsystem does.
2. WHY it exists as a separate unit - the design problem it solves. This is the most valuable
   sentence on the page; a reader can already see the file list, they cannot see the rationale.
3. How control or data flows through it, naming the specific symbols involved.
4. How it connects to the neighbouring subsystems in that item's own `related_files`.

Each item's `files` array is structural: it may only contain paths and symbols that appear in
THAT SAME item's own brief - never mix content from one subsystem's brief into a different
subsystem's response. Never invent a file, function, or line number.

Each item's `description` prose is NOT restricted to that one subsystem - you may reference and
cite any file in the repository, including ones in its own `related_files`, using
`path/to/file.py:123` citations. Every citation is checked against the scan independently per
item, and that specific item's page is discarded if any of its citations do not resolve - a bad
citation in one item's description never affects any other item's result. Cite only line numbers
that item was actually given. No markdown fences, no top-level keys other than the ids you were
given."""

    """You write the reference page for EACH of several source files in a codebase wiki, in a
single response. The input is normally a JSON array of file items directly. If repo-wide context
is available for this build, the input is instead a JSON object {"items": [...], "repo_context":
{...}} - in that case "items" is that same array of file items, and "repo_context" (see below)
applies to every item in it. Either way, each file item has an "id" (echo this back exactly as the
key in your response - never invent your own id), the file's path, its key functions/classes with
line numbers, the subsystem it belongs to, the files it imports and is imported by, and - in
`related_symbols` - a few named functions/classes with line numbers from those related files.

"repo_context", when present, is repo-wide facts from other scanners - the same value applies to
every item, not just one. Use it in an item's own page only when genuinely relevant to THAT item's
file - never force it in, and never use it to write content for a different item. Exactly three
kinds of entry inside it carry a real, citable `file`/`line` and may be cited the same as any other
citation: `database_schema.tables` (where the table itself was created), `database_schema.relations`
(each foreign-key relation), and `api_endpoints` (each HTTP route). Every other field -
`dependency_vulnerabilities`, `dependency_licenses`, `dead_code`, `infrastructure`, and
`environment_variables` - has NO file or line attached at all. You may mention one of these by name
in an item's page, but NEVER write a `path:line` citation for one - it is fabricated and will fail
verification, discarding that item's whole page.

Respond with ONLY a single JSON object with one entry per item you were given, keyed by that
item's "id" (as a string): {"<id>": {"detail": "<markdown, 250-400 words>"}, "<id>": {...}, ...}

Structure each item's markdown with these headings, in order:

## Overview
What this file is responsible for, in two or three sentences.

## Why it exists
The design problem this file solves and why it is a separate file. If the answer is visible in the
code - a separation of concerns, a protocol boundary, a compatibility shim - say so specifically.
Skip this heading only if the file is a trivial re-export.

## How it works
The main flow through the file, naming concrete symbols and citing them as `path:line`. This is
where a reader learns the mechanism, so prefer specifics over restating names.

## Key symbols
A short bulleted list: `` `name` (path:line) `` followed by what it does and when it runs.

## Gotchas
Anything surprising a reader would otherwise trip on - ordering constraints, mutation,
deprecations. Omit this heading if the code shows nothing surprising; do not invent one.

Prefer depth over breadth within each heading: a reader who opens a file page wants the
mechanism, not a restatement of the symbol list they can already see.

Cite as `path/to/file.py:123`, using only line numbers given for THAT item. You may cite the
imported and importing files listed for that item, not just the item's own file - use that item's
own `related_symbols` for those, it is the only source of real line numbers outside the file
itself. A cross-file citation using a name or line not present there will fail verification, so do
not guess at a related file's internals beyond what it lists. Every citation is checked against
the scan independently per item, and that item's page is discarded if any of ITS citations do not
resolve - a bad citation in one item's page never affects any other item's result. Describe only
what that item's given symbols support - never invent a symbol, a line number, or behaviour you
cannot see, and never mix content from one file's item into a different file's response. No
markdown fences around any response, no top-level keys other than the ids you were given."""
