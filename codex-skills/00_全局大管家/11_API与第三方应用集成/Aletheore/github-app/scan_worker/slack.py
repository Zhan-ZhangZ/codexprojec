    string straight to an httpx client, which re-resolves DNS itself at
    request time - independently of, and later than, any validation a
    caller happened to do first. A webhook URL that resolves to a public
    IP when saved (passing validation) can have its DNS repointed at an
    internal address before the next alert fires; the old code would then
    happily connect there. Resolving once here and pinning the real
    request to that exact IP (see aletheore.healthcheck.opener_for, the
    same mechanism already proven for the health-check sweep) closes the
    window to zero instead of merely narrowing it. Raises UnsafeURLError

    urllib.error.URLError/HTTPError/OSError on a real delivery failure -
