"""Deterministic correction for a real Flash Review false-positive
mechanism: a diff hunk's header shows the nearest preceding class/module
signature as a git heuristic (readability only), not proof the hunk's
lines are still nested inside it. FLASH_REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT now cautions
the model about this directly, but that caution alone measured as a
partial mitigation on a real re-run (2 of 3 repeats still misread it) -
this module closes the gap deterministically instead of relying on the
model to reliably self-correct: it re-parses each hunk's own file at the
hunk's real, fresh content (never possibly-stale scan evidence - see
aletheore.scope_lookup's own docstring) and, only when git's claimed
context genuinely disagrees with the real enclosing scope, states the
correction as a fact rather than leaving the model to reason about an
ambiguous header alone.

Deliberately silent (no fact emitted) when scope_lookup returns None
(unsupported language, module-level hunk, or unparseable content) or when
git's header agrees with the real scope - this is a targeted correction
for a proven failure mode, not a running commentary on every hunk.
