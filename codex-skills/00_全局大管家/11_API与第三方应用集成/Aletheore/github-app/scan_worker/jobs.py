# undertaken here (installation_spend_lock exists but is not used by

# million tokens (see app_server/llm_cost.py's MODEL_RATES_PER_MILLION_USD)
# and compact mode keeps prompts to diff + evidence only, so a real review
# should land well under this - but reasoning-token output on a single
# unusually large diff is the failure mode this needs to survive without
# under-reserving. Small relative to a real monthly cap (the base AIR plan's
# is ~$15, see monthly_cap_for_installation), so it doesn't meaningfully

# above - the exact gap independent audit of PR #562 already flagged and
# fixed for the two full-build jobs, just not swept into these five at the
# time. Same reasoning as WIKI_FULL_BUILD_LLM_RESERVE_USD/
# FLASH_REVIEW_SPEND_RESERVE_USD applies to each: size the reserve close to
# (or, where the real cost varies a lot, conservatively above) a single
# real call's likely cost so the atomic reserve-per-call check actually
# bounds concurrent overshoot, rather than passing trivially every time.

# run_managed_audit's reasoning phase is agentic (adapter.invoke, not a
# single simple_completion - see aletheore.report.run_reasoning_phase) and

# conversation prefix (managed_audit measured 96% cache hit on that
# append-only prefix in a real test, per MODEL_RATES_PER_MILLION_USD's own
# comment - real, but not 100%, so the uncached tail of a large-repo audit
# turn is still the failure mode to size against). deepseek-v4-flash's
# $0.44/$1.32 per-million rate applied to a large tool-result-laden turn

    prerequisite for the incremental scan cache
    (aletheore.evidence._load_unchanged_scan_cache) actually helping -
    without a persistent checkout, every scan starts from nothing to
    diff against, same as a fresh clone.

    Mirrors _clone_ref's exact proven-working shape: a plain `git fetch`
    (no explicit refspec) followed by `git checkout <sha>`, rather than
    fetching the SHA directly - GitHub does not reliably allow fetching a
    bare SHA unless it happens to be reachable from an advertised ref,
    the same reason _clone_ref itself relies on a full clone's implicit
    ref fetching rather than fetching head_sha directly. `pr_number`, when
    given, lets _checkout_sha fall back to fetching that PR's own
    `refs/pull/<n>/head` if the plain fetch above didn't advertise
    `checkout_sha` at all - see _checkout_sha's own docstring for the real
    production bug (a deleted source branch) this closes.

    `git remote set-url` runs on every reuse so a rotated access token
    (see _clone_url - `url` always carries a fresh one) doesn't leave
    this checkout stuck fetching against a stale URL baked in at clone
    time.

    That same `git remote set-url`/`git clone` call, though, is what
    writes the token into checkout_dir/.git/config - and unlike the
    ephemeral clones this function is an alternative to (deleted with
    the whole job_dir within minutes), this checkout lives on a mounted,
    reused-across-scans volume. Left as-is, a still-live installation
    token would sit at rest on disk for as long as this checkout exists,
    not just for the few seconds the fetch/clone needs it. Reset back to
    a credential-less URL immediately after: this checkout's next reuse
    calls `git remote set-url` again with a fresh token before it fetches.

    scanner added there (PMD, 2026-09-22, after this docstring was first
    written) flows through automatically with no change needed here - see
    history.py's _compute_curated_diff for how that category is built
    from the SAME base/head evidence run_pr_scan_job already produces

    (2026-09-21) to add Bearer here via
    a diff-scoped pass (materializing just the PR's changed files into a
    throwaway checkout, bounded by PR size instead of Bearer's real
    300s+-on-this-repo full-scan cost) measured WORSE results, not
    equivalent-but-cheaper ones: isolating this repo's own jobs.py (even

    calls the full-repo scan correctly recognizes as safe - Bearer's
    dataflow sanitization reasoning depends on cross-file context a
    diff-scoped checkout structurally can't provide, confirmed twice, not
    a fluke. Joern's CPG-based whole-program analysis depends on that kind
    of context even more, so it wasn't attempted at all. Both stay

    customer-facing surface already does (see static_analysis/__init__.py's
    module comment): path/line/message only, never tool/rule_id - true of
    both the summary text and the inline annotations below.

    Also posts each finding as a real inline Checks-API annotation on its
    own file:line (up to GitHub's real 50-per-request limit, batched via
    create_check_run's own annotations handling for anything beyond that),
    not just the summary block - a finding lands on the diff itself, the

    fires per-comment, not per-PR) and its own tracked identity across
    re-reviews (see migration 059's docstring).

    A finding already tracked for this PR is left untouched except for
    last_seen_sha (no repost, no duplicate) - or, if it had previously been

    reintroduced), the comment is edited back to its normal body and

    looked where it was anchored (reviewed_scope: the diff lines this
    review covered, see _reviewed_scope). A review of a push that never
    touched that file (a merge of the base branch, a docs-only commit, a
    file the review could not read) cannot re-find anything there, so
    "not found" says nothing and the finding is left alone. reviewed_scope
    None means no coverage information, which is treated the same way:

    summary comment said "4 finding(s) posted" from `len(findings_to_post)`
    while only 3 inline comments actually existed on the PR - counting
    what was attempted, not what a reviewer could actually see. A
    reappeared-and-failed-to-un-resolve finding isn't counted as a failure
    here: its comment already exists and is visible on the PR (just still

    """Gates a job that makes several sequential LLM calls (managed audits,
    AIRview/Docs full builds) against the monthly dollar cap.

    can_start_next_call() used to compare against a `current_spend` snapshot
    read once when the budget object was created, plus an in-process
    spent_this_job counter - invisible to any OTHER concurrent job spending
    against the same installation's cap (a Flash Review, or a second
    AIRview/Docs build) for the whole duration of this one, sometimes
    minutes long. Now reserves atomically per call instead (see
    reserve_llm_spend, the same primitive run_flash_review_job's cap check
    uses): each call to can_start_next_call() re-reads and compares against
    the real current total in one atomic statement, so two jobs racing each
    other can no longer both reserve more than the cap actually has room
    for - PROVIDED `next_call_reserve_usd` is itself sized close to the
    real cost of the call it precedes (see WIKI_FULL_BUILD_LLM_RESERVE_USD/
    DOCS_FULL_BUILD_LLM_RESERVE_USD's own comments - the constructor's
    default, DEFAULT_LLM_NEXT_CALL_RESERVE_USD, is a near-zero placeholder
    that leaves this guarantee real in name only for a caller that doesn't
    override it, found via independent audit of PR #562: two-plus
    concurrent callers can each pass a trivial reservation and only have
    their real, much larger cost land afterward via record_usage, letting
    overshoot scale with how many calls are concurrently in that window
    rather than being bounded to one call's worth.

    Known residual gaps, not addressed here:
    - A *catchable* failure between can_start_next_call() reserving and
      record_usage() truing up (a real API exception, a 200 with no usage
      field, etc.) is closed: on_call_failed() below releases exactly that
      reservation, and every real construction site in this file wires it
      through the adapter chain's own on_call_failed hook. An *uncatchable*
      failure in that same window - a hard process kill (OOM-kill, SIGKILL,
      host crash), where no Python code ever runs to call on_call_failed()
      - is also closed, but not by this class's own in-process bookkeeping:
      reserve_llm_spend is an immediate real DB balance deduction, so
      can_start_next_call() and _release_pending()/record_usage() also
      persist/clear a row in llm_spend_reservations (see
      upsert_pending_llm_spend_reservation/clear_pending_llm_spend_
      reservation), and run_llm_spend_reservation_sweep_job periodically
      finds and releases any row old enough that no owning process could
      still legitimately be running - the same class of gap
      model_tiers._reserve_openai_free_tier_budget has a different fix for
      (a self-expiring daily Redis counter, which only works because that
      cap resets every day; this one does not, so it needs the persisted
      sweep instead).
    - No mechanism here fully serializes every LLM-spending feature
      against the same installation's cap (installation_spend_lock exists
      and is used by Flash Review, but not by either AIRview/Docs
      full-build job) - a correctly-sized reservation narrows the
      concurrent-overshoot window per call, it does not close it. Fully
      closing it needs a real per-installation execution lock spanning
      every feature, a much larger change than sizing this constant
      correctly and not undertaken here."""

    (LIVE_WIKI_INCREMENTAL_UPDATE_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS) doesn't change what
    a customer sees for the PR review itself - only what happens to the
    wiki update when it runs long.

    this repo persisting before this job runs would otherwise make it
