"""Hosted persistence for the durable, incrementally-updated code graph:
files -> symbols -> dependency edges -> endpoints, keyed by
installation_id/repo_full_name/branch (same convention as
postgres_graph_store.py's git-history graph). The counterpart to
repo_history's evidence JSONB blob snapshot, but addressable at
file/symbol/edge/endpoint granularity and updated incrementally - only
the rows for files that actually changed (see aletheore.code_graph_diff)
