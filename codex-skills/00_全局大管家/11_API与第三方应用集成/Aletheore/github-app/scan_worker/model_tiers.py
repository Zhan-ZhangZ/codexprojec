"""Which LLM Aletheore's paid AI work actually runs on - the pricing
page's model claims are read from this file, not written separately, so
they can never drift from what actually runs.

GPT-5.6 Luna was the primary model for every writing surface as of
2026-08-09 (see git history for the full reasoning). As of 2026-10-04,
AIRview, managed audits, Docs, and endpoint-health fix suggestions moved
to IndieRouter as the primary provider (`writing_adapter_for_airview`,
`writing_adapter_for_managed_audit`, `writing_adapter_for_docs`,
`writing_adapter_for_health_fix_suggestion` below) - one balance, one
account, one privacy disclosure, and measured parity-or-better on every
surface (docs/operations/LLM-CONSOLIDATION-HANDOVER-2026-10-03.md, local-
only). PR review (`flash_review_generation_adapter`) was already on
IndieRouter before this. The plain `writing_adapter_for` below (still used
by Docs' fallback branch) keeps its original Luna-preferred behavior
unchanged, for whichever surface or fallback path still reaches it.

Every IndieRouter-primary builder falls back to its own pre-existing
direct-provider path, unchanged, if INDIEROUTER_API_KEY isn't configured -
logged, never silent, so a build never hard-fails on missing infra and
this is never mistaken for the intended path. (The retired gpt-5.6-terra
rollout crashed instead of falling back, but only because its price entry
was missing from llm_cost.py, not because it lacked a fallback path -
every model here needs a llm_cost.py entry before its first real call.)

    behavior-changed-before-reporting comparison, and diff-hunk-header-
    is-not-proof-of-nesting. Two OTHER candidate rules (a local-logic
    sanity check, a host-language-escaping warning) were tried and
    REJECTED: on the same full-corpus protocol they measured 61.7% avg
    with a much wider, noisier spread (49.1-71.7%) when tested alongside
    a since-superseded 4-rule baseline - a real, reproducible cost, unlike
    the 2 rules that shipped, which cost nothing measurable. A bare-4-rule
    version (without the 2 behavior/hunk-header rules) scored 60.0% avg
    (57.9-62.1%) on this same full-corpus protocol - the two are
    statistically indistinguishable, so the 6-rule version shipped for its
    extra real bug-class coverage at no measured cost, not because it
    scored higher. A keycloak-only 10-PR pilot of the 4-rule config scored
    higher (66.3% avg) and an even earlier, bare-PR-Agent-prompt-with-no-
    safety-rules keycloak-only pilot scored 62.4% avg (8 runs) - both real
    numbers from real runs, but both from the smaller, single-repo subset
    that consistently overstated effects relative to the full corpus all
    night; cited here only for provenance, not as numbers that justified
    shipping.
    temperature=0.2 is PR-Agent's own real production default (their
    configuration.toml), never previously set anywhere in this codebase.
    reasoning_effort=low is a separate, independently validated lever
    specific to GLM-5.3 (its thinking mode cannot be disabled, only
    steered - "low" measured the same or better quality than the default
    effort while avoiding the real timeouts "high"/"max" hit on longer
    prompts) - unrelated to prompt wording, kept regardless of provider.

    Sarvam was evaluated side-by-side as an alternative host for the same
    model and rejected: real production instability isn't the concern (a
    corrected model id and explicit reasoning_effort=low fixed its earlier
    crashes), but it ran out of API credits mid-run and measured slower
    (avg 11.8s/call vs IndieRouter's 8.2s) - IndieRouter was also the
    provider every number above was actually validated against, so
    switching hosts now would be an untested variable on top of an
    already-large prompt/model change to the paid review path.

    Falls back to the existing Luna-or-DeepSeek path (writing_adapter_for's
    own default, via `fallback_model`) if INDIEROUTER_API_KEY isn't
    configured, so a deploy that hasn't rolled the new credential out yet
    degrades to the previous known-good behavior instead of hard-failing
    every Flash Review. `fallback_model` defaults to the same real
    DeepSeek model flash_review.FLASH_REVIEW_FALLBACK_MODEL names (passed
    explicitly by callers rather than imported directly, since flash_review
    imports FROM this module - importing back would be circular); passing
    GLM-5.3-Flash's own model id here would be wrong, since

    Primary path settings (docs/operations/LLM-CONSOLIDATION-HANDOVER-
    2026-10-03.md, local-only): reasoning_effort=low (kept the slow arm's
    quality - +0.44/+0.59 vs RepoWise on two judges - while building in
    ~193s; reasoning off or default effort both scored lower at this
    concurrency/batch size) and AIRVIEW_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS. Does NOT
    turn on json_mode even though real call sites pass json_output=True:
    AIRview has never actually reached a provider's real JSON mode (the
    DeepSeek-direct fallback below silently drops json_output on its own
    branch of writing_adapter_for - see that function's docstring), so
    this preserves existing real behavior rather than changing the
    provider and the JSON-mode behavior in the same change. Not a
    theoretical risk: this exact combination (deepseek-v4.1-flash via
    IndieRouter, effort low, no json_mode) is what the handover's own
    AIRview benchmark actually ran end to end - every subsystem/file-page
    description it reports parsing successfully was parsed with
    _parse_json_object's strict json.loads, no json_mode, no leniency.

    Falls back to the pre-existing, unchanged DeepSeek-direct path (never
    Luna - see below) if INDIEROUTER_API_KEY isn't configured.

    Every other writing surface prefers Luna over DeepSeek when available
    (writing_adapter_for above) because Luna measured better on real-world
    coding/PR-review benchmarks - that is still true and unchanged here.
    AIRview's own comprehension benchmark (aletheore-benchmarks,
    AIRVIEW_GAP.md) measured the opposite for this one surface: the full
    12-question architecture set, 3 judge repeats, deepseek-v4-flash scored
    1.88 against RepoWise's 1.99 (a statistical tie, inside the judge's own
    noise floor) while gpt-5.6-luna scored 1.53 against RepoWise's 2.08 (a
    real loss, outside it) - same corpus, same day, same rubric. Scoped
    narrowly to AIRview because that is exactly what was measured; PR
    review was not re-tested and stays on Luna via the plain
    writing_adapter_for fallback path. Managed audits also moved to IndieRouter
    separately - see writing_adapter_for_managed_audit below.

    MANAGED_AUDIT_MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS=40 ceiling (openai_compatible.py - see
    its own comment for why this is explicit here rather than the plain
    adapter default) - measured directly against this repository via the

    17/17 facts and fewer unverified citations (2) than default
    reasoning's 24-round, $0.67 run (5 unverified) - comfortably inside
    the ceiling either way (docs/operations/LLM-CONSOLIDATION-HANDOVER-
    2026-10-03.md, local-only). Re-verified live against this repository
    on 2026-10-04 (real IndieRouter call, not mocked): 5 rounds, 109.6s,
    $0.147, a full coherent report. Falls back to the pre-existing,
    unchanged DeepSeek-Flash-direct path (supports_tool_choice=False
    there - see writing_adapter_for's own comment on why; same
    MANAGED_AUDIT_MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS applies there too, since the hosted
    feature's cost reserve is already sized for it regardless of which
    provider actually answers) if INDIEROUTER_API_KEY isn't configured.

    Never Luna (the plain writing_adapter_for fallback's default) and
    never DeepSeek Pro either, on either path. Measured directly, three real full audit runs
    against this repository, same evidence, same manual: Luna cost $0.15
    (6 rounds) and missed a real circular import; deepseek-v4-pro cost
    $1.15 (14 rounds) and caught it; deepseek-v4-flash cost $0.40 (16
    rounds) and also caught it. Pro's 3x-higher per-token rate over flash
    bought nothing here - pro actually used fewer total tokens than flash,
    so the extra cost was pure list-price premium, not more work done, for
    a shorter report and the identical finding. Flash is the only one of
    the three that is both accurate (matches Pro's finding) and cheap (a
    fraction of Pro's cost) for this specific task.

    This doesn't generalize from AIRview's own Luna-vs-DeepSeek finding
    above (or the other direction, Luna-preferred by default elsewhere):
    managed_audit is multi-round agentic tool use, not a single completion,
    and its cost is ~96% input-token-driven because every round re-sends
    the entire accumulated conversation - round-trip efficiency dominates
    over any model's per-token list price, which is exactly what made Pro
    the expensive choice here despite its higher-tier positioning.
