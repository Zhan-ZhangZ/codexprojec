    # callback to touch a heartbeat from between jobs, and the gap between
    # jobs here is normally minutes, not seconds. This only proves the
    # process hasn't fully deadlocked (see heartbeat.py's docstring) - a
    # weaker guarantee than "RQ is actually dequeuing," but a real
    # improvement over no detection at all, which is what let the health

    # takes "email" - transactional sends are single fast HTTP calls, not
    # the multi-minute AI jobs "scans" carries, so this doesn't reintroduce
    # the contention problem "health" was split out to fix in the first
    # place.
