"""Repo-wide scanner context for AIRview prompts.

AIRview's subsystem/file-page prompts (live_wiki.py) are built entirely
from `repository.modules` + the import graph (`related_files`) - none of
the other scanners (database schema, API endpoints, dependency
vulnerabilities/licenses, dead code, infrastructure, environment
variables) ever reach the model. This module builds a single compact,
repo-wide summary of those sections to attach alongside `brief`/
`related_files` in every generation call, the same way `related_files`
already crosses cluster boundaries to give the model context beyond its
own subsystem.

Kept intentionally compact (names, paths, counts - not full nested
structures) since this rides on every single generation call in a build,
not just one: a 198-row raw dependency-license list would roughly double
prompt size for no benefit most subsystems ever need.

Schema/endpoint entries that carry a real file:line are safe to cite -
`citation_verifier.verify_citations` checks against ALL known repo file
paths, not just the calling cluster's own brief. Vulnerability/license/
dead-code/infrastructure/env-var facts are repo-level, not tied to one
file, so the system prompt is told to treat those as background, not to
manufacture a citation for them.
