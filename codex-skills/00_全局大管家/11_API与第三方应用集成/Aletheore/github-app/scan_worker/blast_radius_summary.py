    Real gap found on final review: `compute_blast_radius`'s `per_target`
    counts come from `find_blast_radius`, which truncates a single
    target's `direct_dependents` to 50 *before* the already-in-PR
    exclusion runs - fine for a rendered, human-read, already-capped list
    (`blast_radius_summary`'s own output), but a per-file count surfaced
    as an exact number (the PR file-overview section's "N dependents")
    must not silently undercount a hub file just because the cap fired
    first. This reads the raw adjacency list instead, so there's nothing
    to truncate.

    Returns {path: count} only for paths in `changed_files` that both
    exist as a scanned module in `evidence` and have at least one such
