"""AI-enhanced per-symbol descriptions on top of the deterministic, evidence-
only rendering in aletheore.docs_reference. Same discipline as live_wiki.py:
generate, then verify before trusting - an unverifiable attempt never
overrides known-good deterministic content (a docstring the developer
actually wrote, or the honest "Undocumented" label).

Unlike AIRview's citation_verifier.verify_citations (built for prose that
cites file:line references across a multi-file brief), a symbol description
carries no citations of its own - docs_reference.py's citation line is
rendered deterministically, outside the model's control. The actual risk
here is the model inventing behavior the given snippet doesn't show, which
citation-checking can't catch - so this module's verification is narrower
and purpose-built: reject any response for a symbol name that wasn't asked
about (the one thing that IS mechanically checkable), and nothing more.
Content correctness is a prompt-design problem (tight snippet, explicit
"describe only what's shown" instruction), not a post-hoc-checkable one.
