"""jina-embed client for evidence-packet and flash-review similarity caching.

Replaced Ollama+nomic-embed-text after a real, corrected 6-language
retrieval benchmark showed jina-embeddings-v2-base-code beating nomic on
every metric (75.0/93.1/95.8% vs 73.6/87.5/91.7% top-1/3/5 pooled), while
bge-m3 actually underperformed nomic. See jina_embed/server.py, which
serves this model behind a plain /embed endpoint.

# against the new model's real limit: it was already comfortably safe for
# real evidence-packet sizes under nomic, and a truncated embedding is
# still useful for similarity matching - the exact text match isn't
# needed, and a cache hit is always re-verified against current evidence
# regardless of how it was found.

# at the new service - it's what makes an old row's cached vector
