"""High-confidence, evidence-only checks for common PR regressions.

These checks intentionally cover a small set of patterns where the changed
file and a referenced definition prove the behavior. They are not a general
static analyzer and return no finding when the necessary evidence is absent.

Every check is scoped to the diff hunk nearest the call site being examined,
not the whole file. A whole-file scope was tried first and rejected: with
file_contents holding the entire current file and referenced_symbol_context
bundling up to 8 unrelated referenced symbols, a whole-file scan means any
matching keyword anywhere in the file - an unrelated except block, an
unrelated added loop, an unrelated ThreadPoolExecutor three functions away -
satisfies a check's condition regardless of whether it has anything to do
with the call being examined. That is a real false-positive surface on
ordinary PRs that touch more than one thing in the same file, and it also
runs in reverse: an unrelated exception handler elsewhere in the file can
mask a genuine regression at the actual call site. Scoping to the nearest
hunk (DIFF_HUNK_TOLERANCE lines, matching flash_review.py's own
DIFF_LINE_TOLERANCE/LINE_CITATION_CONTEXT_WINDOW convention) keeps a check
from firing on evidence that has no spatial relationship to the change it is
supposedly evidence for.

Two check families need a resolved referenced_symbol_context (a cross-file
dependency the diff calls into) to have anything to reason about: the
exception/iterator/mutation/scaling/concurrency/retry checks in
_check_reference_at_call, and the moved-record-operation check in
_moved_record_findings. The rest - _resource_leak_findings,
_copy_to_alias_findings, _swallowed_exception_findings, and
_shell_injection_findings - read only the diff and the current file, and
never require a referenced symbol at all. This split is deliberate and
measured, not incidental: a corpus evaluation against 18 real historical
bugs (benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/scripts/evaluate_semantic_checks.py)
found a resolvable in-repo referenced symbol in only 6 of them - most real
diffs call no in-repo symbol at all (a same-function bug, a call into a
third-party package, a call into the standard library). A check that can
only ever run when that narrow condition holds will only ever fire on a
narrow slice of real bugs, however precise its logic is once it does run.

    """A sibling gap to the main loop below: this check only ever looked
    for the `except` line itself inside hunk.added - a PR that replaces
    an EXISTING except block's body with a bare `pass`, without touching
    the except line's own text, is invisible to that path entirely.
    _diff_hunks_by_file never records unchanged context lines into
    hunk.added/removed (only +/- lines), so an unchanged except header
    sitting just above the hunk's real change has nowhere to be matched.

    Real, previously-identified-but-deferred gap: commit bad16b7's own
    message documented this as a second, real (not theoretical) finding
    from the same review that fixed the comment-scoping bug, and said it
    "needs new detection logic... tracked separately" - that follow-up
    was never implemented until now.

    Real Flash Review finding on this check's first version: gating on
    the WHOLE hunk's added/removed content (was the hunk's real added
    content exactly `pass`, was its real removed content more than
    `pass`) doesn't prove the removed content actually belonged to the
    except block a match happened to find nearby - an unchanged handler
    that already legitimately contains `pass` could be falsely reported
    when an unrelated change elsewhere in the SAME hunk replaces real
    code with `pass`. Scoped instead to hunk.raw_body - every body line
    in original diff order with its real "-"/"+"/" " tag still attached
    - walking forward from the except header's own position and
    reconstructing the OLD (context + removed) and NEW (context + added)
    body text separately, stopping at the first line back at or above
    the except's own indentation. Only that block's own old/new content
    is compared, the same reconstruction technique github_api.py's
    _trim_patch_context uses for old/new hunk text generally.

# a verified real-bug example. Replace this comment with a real citation
# if/when one turns up (none of this project's own 25 benchmark cases or

#
# Deliberately conservative like every other check here: only recognizes a

# Java sibling of _shell_injection_findings above - same risk shape (a
# variable concatenated directly into a command string), but the real
# risk here is narrower and differently shaped than the Python/Go
# versions - a genuine false positive caught by Aletheore's own Flash
# Review on the PR that introduced this check
# (github.com/Aletheore/Aletheore/pull/725). Runtime.exec(String) and
# ProcessBuilder never invoke a shell at all (unlike os.system/subprocess
# with shell=True, or Go's exec.Command("sh", "-c", ...)) - so "shell
# injection"/"shell metacharacters" is factually wrong for either. Two
# real consequences: (1) ProcessBuilder is dropped from this check
# entirely - passing one concatenated string as its sole argument doesn't
# correspond to a real exploitable shape at all (it names one literal
# program with a space in it, which just fails to launch, since
# ProcessBuilder never shell-splits); (2) Runtime.exec(String command)
# does have a real, different, narrower risk worth flagging - it
# naively splits the command on whitespace and executes the pieces
# directly (no shell metacharacter interpretation), so a value that adds
# extra whitespace-separated tokens can inject additional arguments
# (CWE-88, argument injection) even though it can't inject a `;`/`|`/
# backtick shell command the way the Python/Go checks' targets can. No
# real corpus case or CVE citation for this exact Java shape yet (same
# honesty note as the Java empty-catch check).

# Asymmetric cache trust: a new security/permission check that guards two
# different cache lookups before deciding an outcome, but doesn't give them
# the same trust - one returns unconditionally on a cache hit (Go's comma-ok
# idiom, `if _, ok := X.Get(...); ok { ... return }`), the other - a helper
# wrapping a cache read, `v, err := someCachedThing(...); if err == nil {
# ... }` - branches internally before deciding whether to return, so at
# least one of its outcomes falls through instead of short-circuiting. If
# both guard the same underlying decision, a cache hit for one outcome can
# end up trusted while the other is always re-verified (or vice versa),
# letting a stale cached result outlive the state change that should have
# invalidated it.
#
# Real, validated example: grafana/grafana#103633 - a new permDenialCache
# hit returns immediately, but a cache hit via getCachedIdentityPermissions
# only short-circuits when the cached result is a grant; a cached denial
# still falls through to a fresh DB lookup, which is itself the SAME shape
# as the real bug (grants trusted, denials re-derived - the golden finding's
# actual asymmetry direction). Confirmed no LLM caught this across a full
# night of testing (2026-09-20/21): GLM-5.3-Flash, DeepSeek-V4-Flash,
# gpt-5.6-luna, gpt-4.1-mini, o4-mini, and three open-weight models, across
# a plain prompt, a targeted rewritten safety rule specifically naming this
# pattern, and full tool-executing agent mode with real grep/read access to
# the complete repo, all missed it - this check exists because that gap is
# real and repeatable, not hypothetical. Validated zero false positives
# across the other 14 real diffs in this session's own benchmark corpus
# (13 PR-review-benchmark cases plus 2 additional real security-tagged
# cases) - a single true-positive example, so treat the false-positive rate
# on genuinely novel code as unproven beyond that, not as a large-sample
# guarantee.
#
# Intentionally narrow and Go-only (gated by is_go at the call site, same
# convention as _shell_injection_findings_go): flags the STRUCTURAL
# asymmetry as worth a look, not a proven bug - a legitimate reason for two
# cache guards to have different trust levels can exist, and only
# Aletheore's LLM review layer (which sees this finding alongside the full
# diff) can tell a real bug from an intentional design choice.

    """A hunk that edits a string literal's own content (not adds or
    removes a whole one) sometimes drops one closing double-quote off a
    nested quoted phrase inside it - real example: pallets/flask PR #5344
    (this project's own benchmark case 001), where a multi-line error-
    message call got reformatted onto one line and `"--key"` lost its
    closing `"` along the way, producing the malformed literal text
    `"--key is not used.` instead of `"--key" is not used.`. The string
    itself still parses fine either way - the OUTER Python/Go/JS string
    delimiter is untouched, only the message's own nested quoted phrase
    breaks - so nothing about this is a syntax error a linter or the
    language's own parser would catch. It also survived three different
    LLM prompt variants tried against this exact case, including an
    explicit character-by-character quote-check instruction (see PR #716's
    "Known open gap" and case 001's own scoring history) - the miss isn't
    a prompt-wording problem, it's a case for exactly this kind of
    deterministic, code-verified check.

    Deliberately scoped to a real EDIT (both hunk.removed and hunk.added
    non-empty) with high textual similarity between the two sides - a hunk
    that adds a brand new string or deletes one wholesale is a different
    situation this isn't evidence about.

    Real bug found and fixed via this project's own Flash Review dogfood
    review of this exact PR (#717), twice over:

    1. The first version counted raw `"` characters across the WHOLE hunk
       and compared even/odd parity - so an edit to one string's content
       could get smeared together with an unrelated quote-containing
       change elsewhere in the same hunk (a separate string, a trailing
       comment with a stray `"`), flipping the aggregate parity for a
       reason that had nothing to do with any actual phrase losing its
       closing quote.
    2. A line-level SequenceMatcher.get_opcodes() re-scoping (tried next,
       during this same fix) only separates edits when an EXACTLY
       matching line sits between them in the diff - two adjacent but
       unrelated changed lines with nothing identical between them still
       land in one merged "replace" block, so it didn't actually close
       the gap in the general case.

    Fixed properly by checking PHRASE PRESENCE instead of counting
    anything: for each complete `"phrase"` in the hunk's removed text,
    check whether that exact phrase's opening quote survives in the added
    text without its closing quote following it (a negative lookahead
    excluding another quote or a word character, so `"foo"`
    edited into `"foobar"` - a real, harmless content change, not a
    broken phrase - correctly does NOT match, since "foo" is immediately
    followed by the word character "b" in "foobar"). This is immune to
    unrelated quotes anywhere else in the hunk by construction: it never
    counts or aggregates anything, it only asks "did THIS specific phrase
    that used to be complete lose its closing quote", which no unrelated
    string or comment elsewhere can answer differently.

# find_static_analysis_regressions (Semgrep+Bearer, diff-scoped via a

# a real, controlled "with evidence" experiment that session (merging its
# findings into Flash Review's own output) measured WORSE recall and
# precision than bare Flash Review on the same 13-case/44-golden-bug
# corpus, corroborating docs/audits/deterministic_scanner_evaluation.md's
# earlier finding that this diff-scoped Semgrep+Bearer path contributed
# zero true positives to PR review with real noise. Superseded by a
# dedicated, non-LLM-merged GitHub Check Run (jobs.py's
# _maybe_create_static_analysis_check_run) reading the SAME scanner
# family's findings off run_pr_scan_job's real base/head checkouts
# instead of a synthetic one - same signal, without the LLM-merge
# downside this removal is based on.
