# documented way to retrieve file 301+ from this endpoint at all (see
# app_server/webhooks/push.py's own GITHUB_COMPARE_FILES_HARD_CAP,
# fixed first for the push-webhook path). Real gap found via audit:
# fetch_pr_diff and fetch_pr_changed_files below both hit this exact
# same endpoint and both silently accepted whatever `files` GitHub
# returned with no signal when the response was capped - unlike every
# other truncation boundary in this file (MAX_CONTEXT_FILE_BYTES,
# MAX_DIFF_TOTAL_BYTES), which are all honestly tracked
# (omitted_files/budget_omitted_files). A PR changing 300+ files had
# every file past the cap silently invisible to both Flash Review's
# diff/context building AND the changed-files list ignored_paths
# filtering and schema/endpoint context build off of - with nothing
# logged, unlike the push-webhook path.

# per-review input cost, ~$0.011->$0.022 at Luna's rate - see MAX_CONTEXT_
# TOTAL_BYTES's own history) rather than a fresh re-benchmark: scaling the

# formula the 44% figure uses throughout, not (cap-cost)/cap; an earlier
# version of this comment mixed the two, understating both figures as
# ~28%/~13% - found via independent audit). MAX_CONTEXT_TOTAL_BYTES intentionally

# BYTES) on file_context since this file's earliest version - but diff_text
# itself, built here, never had an equivalent cap: every file's trimmed
# patch got concatenated unconditionally, however many files or however
# large. Compact mode blanks file_context before it reaches the model (see
# jobs.py), which makes diff_text the one part of the prompt that's never
# reduced - so this was the real, uncapped surface the whole time, just
# never exercised by anything caught in review (a normal PR's total diff
# rarely gets big enough to matter).

# Packs smallest patches first, matching order_changed_files_by_diff_size's
# rationale in flash_review.py (see #473) rather than the largest-first
# convention this originally shipped with (see #474; borrowed from
# PR-Agent's own pr_generate_compressed_diff, which sorts descending). That
# first choice was never validated against anything actually observed to
# fail this way - reversed for two reasons: consistency (having the diff-
# text budget and the evidence-context budget prioritize opposite things
# for adjacent "what gets shown when it doesn't all fit" problems was an
# unreconciled contradiction, caught in review, not by a failing case), and
# because largest-first has a real, concrete failure mode #473's approach
# doesn't: a single huge low-value file (a generated lockfile, a compiled
# bundle) can consume the whole budget and starve several genuinely
# important small files around it - the same shape of miss #473 fixed for
# evidence context, case 007's small surgical fix losing out to size alone.
