"""Tests for _clickable_suggestion/_substitution_parses_cleanly - the gate
deciding whether a Flash Review suggestion is safe to render as a real
GitHub one-click "```suggestion" block instead of today's inert plain
code fence.

This gate exists because GitHub's suggestion feature does a literal,
unreviewed text substitution the instant someone clicks Apply - a wrong
accept here is a wrong commit to a customer's real repository, a
materially different failure mode than a wrong `issue` or `suggestion`
string a human reads before acting on. Every test below either confirms a
genuinely safe case is accepted (and, where relevant, correctly
re-indented), or confirms one specific way a suggestion can be unsafe is
caught - see each test's own docstring for which.

No suggestion is ever clickable any more: the second model that used to check
correctness was removed, and a parse check alone cannot prove a substitution is
right, so every suggestion renders as a plain fence.
