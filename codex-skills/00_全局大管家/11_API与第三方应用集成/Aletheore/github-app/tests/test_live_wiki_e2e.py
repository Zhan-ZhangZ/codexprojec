"""End-to-end verification of the Live Wiki pipeline against this repo's
own real evidence file (.aletheore/air.json), with only the paid LLM API
calls mocked. Everything else - cluster brief extraction, mermaid diagram
generation, citation/symbol grounding validation, Postgres storage, and
the async dashboard read path - runs for real.

This is deliberately separate from test_live_wiki.py and test_jobs.py,
which exercise the same modules against small synthetic evidence and
mock generate_subsystems/_store_wiki_generation at a higher level. Here
the goal is the opposite: real evidence, real orchestration functions,
fake adapters only at the network boundary.
