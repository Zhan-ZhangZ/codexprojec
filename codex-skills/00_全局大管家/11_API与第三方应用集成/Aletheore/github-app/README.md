# Aletheore GitHub App

The hosted service backing the Aletheore GitHub App receives webhooks, runs
`aletheore scan` plus `aletheore diff` for pull requests, posts the result as a
comment, and exposes a JSON dashboard endpoint.

## Local development

```bash
cd src
pip install -e .

cd ../github-app
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Same images and host ports as .github/workflows/github-app-tests.yml's
# services block - a passing run here means a passing run in CI. Without
# this, most of the suite still runs, but everything that needs a real
# database or queue (roughly 40% of it) skips instead of failing, which
# looks like a clean green run and isn't.
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

export TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:test@localhost:55433/aletheore_test
export DATABASE_URL=$TEST_DATABASE_URL
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The test suite applies every file in `migrations/` itself (see the `pool`
fixture in `tests/conftest.py`) - every migration is idempotent, so this
works against a brand-new container with no manual migration step needed.
`requirements-dev.txt` adds pytest on top of `requirements.txt` - the
production images (`Dockerfile.app-server`, `Dockerfile.scan-worker`)
install `requirements.txt` alone, so test tooling never ships to prod.

## Deploying on KVM4

1. Register the GitHub App with webhook URL `https://aletheore.com/webhook`.
2. Grant `contents: read`, `pull_requests: write`, and `checks: write`.
3. Subscribe to `pull_request` only - `installation`/`installation_repositories`
   are delivered automatically for any App with repository permissions.
   For paid managed audits, also subscribe to `issue_comment`.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` on the server and fill the GitHub App ID,
   webhook secret, and Postgres values.
5. Place the downloaded private key at `github-app/app-private-key.pem` -
   `docker-compose.yml` mounts it read-only and points
   `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` at it. Do not paste the key into `.env`
   directly: plain env-file values reject the real newlines in a PEM
   (confirmed empirically against docker run/compose --env-file). Run
   `chmod 644 app-private-key.pem` after placing it - the app-server and
   scan-worker containers run as a non-root user, and a bind-mounted file
   keeps its host-side permissions inside the container.
6. Add the App's Client ID/Client Secret, a random `SESSION_SECRET`, and a real
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env`.
7. Add `https://aletheore.com/auth/callback` as a Callback URL under GitHub App
   user authorization settings.
8. Point `aletheore.com` at the KVM4 server.
9. Run `docker compose up -d --build`. The `app-server` container runs
   `scripts/migrate.py` before starting Uvicorn, so pending migrations are
   applied automatically on every deploy.

Before every deploy, tag the commit you're deploying so a rollback target is
always one command away: `git tag deploy-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ) && git push --tags`.

## Migrations

`docker-compose.yml` still mounts `./migrations` as
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, so a brand-new Postgres volume gets every
migration file applied automatically on first init - but Postgres does that
exactly once, with no record of what it did. Any migration added after a
database already exists needs a real apply step, which used to mean
manually running the right numbered file by hand (easy to forget, easy to
apply twice, easy to apply out of order).

`scripts/migrate.py` replaces that: it tracks applied migrations in a
`schema_migrations` table and only runs files not already recorded there.
Every file in `migrations/` is written to be idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF
NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, ...), so it's always safe to run,
regardless of whether the database is brand new, was bootstrapped by
`docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, or has had some migrations applied by hand in
the past - the first run just backfills `schema_migrations` correctly, and
every run after that is a no-op unless a new migration file was added.

Add new schema changes as a new numbered file in `migrations/`, written
idempotently. The next `app-server` startup runs `scripts/migrate.py`
automatically before serving traffic. You can still run it manually for a
pre-deploy check:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://aletheore:<password>@localhost:5432/aletheore_app \
  python3 scripts/migrate.py
```

## Rollback

There is no image registry in this deployment - `docker compose up -d --build`
builds from whatever is checked out on the server, so rolling back means
checking out a previous commit and rebuilding from it.

1. **Find the last-good commit or deploy tag**: `git log --oneline` or
   `git tag -l 'deploy-*' | sort | tail -5`.
2. **Decide if the bad deploy touched the database.** Migrations here are
   forward-only SQL files with no down-migration - if the deploy that needs
   rolling back applied a schema change you need to undo, the safe path is
   restoring the pre-deploy backup (see Backups below), not hand-writing a
   reverse migration. If it was app-code-only, skip to step 3.
3. **Check out the last-good commit and rebuild**:
   ```
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout <last-good-sha-or-deploy-tag>
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
4. **Verify the rollback actually took**:
   - `docker compose ps` - all services `Up`, no restart loops.
   - `docker compose logs --tail 50 app-server scan-worker health-worker scheduler` -
     clean JSON startup lines, no tracebacks.
   - `GET /v1/health/{org}/{repo}` for a known-good repo returns the expected
     endpoint statuses.
   - If `INTERNAL_METRICS_TOKEN` is set, `GET /v1/internal/queue-stats` shows
     `worker_count >= 1` and a `failed_count` that isn't climbing.
5. **Return to the tip of the branch** once the incident is resolved and a
   fix is ready, rather than staying on the rolled-back commit indefinitely -
   `git checkout master` (or the deploy branch) before the next real deploy.

## Backups

`scripts/backup-postgres.sh` runs `pg_dump` against the running `postgres`
service and writes a timestamped, compressed custom-format dump to
`./backups` (override with a first argument), pruning everything past the
14 most recent backups (override with a second argument). Run it from
`github-app/`, on the same host as `docker-compose.yml`.

Schedule it with cron on the deployment host, for example daily at 03:00 UTC:

```
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/github-app && ./scripts/backup-postgres.sh >> /var/log/aletheore-backup.log 2>&1
```

To restore, use `scripts/restore-postgres.sh <backup-file> [target-db-name]`.
It is destructive - it drops and recreates the target database - and asks
for interactive confirmation of the database name before doing so. Always
rehearse against a throwaway target first, never the live database:

```
./scripts/restore-postgres.sh ./backups/aletheore_app_2026-07-21T00-00-00Z.dump aletheore_app_restore_drill
```

Only once that succeeds and the data looks right would a real recovery use
`aletheore_app` as the target - and only after confirming the app and
worker are stopped or the restored data will immediately start changing
again.

Paid installations can configure endpoint health monitoring through
`PUT /admin/{org}/{repo}/health-check-url`. The route stores the base URL and
optional latency threshold per installation; the scheduled worker checks the
latest scanned endpoint evidence every three minutes and sends Slack-compatible
webhook alerts only when reachability or latency-threshold state changes.

### Health-check and webhook URL policy

Both `health_check_base_url` (above) and `webhook_url`
(`PUT /admin/{org}/{repo}/webhook-url`) are validated by
`app_server/url_validation.py` before being stored, to stop the worker from
being pointed at internal infrastructure on a schedule:

- **Allowed**: `https://` URLs whose hostname resolves to a public,
  routable address.
- **Denied**: any other scheme (plain `http://` included), a URL with no
  hostname, a hostname that fails to resolve, and any hostname that
  resolves to a private (RFC 1918), loopback, link-local (this blocks the
  `169.254.169.254` cloud metadata endpoint), reserved, multicast, or
  unspecified address.

A denied URL is rejected at write time with a `400` and a specific reason
(`URL must use https`, `URL must include a hostname`, `could not resolve
host '<host>'`, or `'<host>' resolves to a disallowed address`) - nothing
unsafe is ever persisted, so there's no separate cleanup step if an admin
tries a bad value.

The dashboard route is a JSON foundation endpoint at `/app/{org}/{repo}`. A
private-repository OAuth gate and rendered UI are deferred fast-follows; do not
install this hosted endpoint for private repositories until that gate exists.
