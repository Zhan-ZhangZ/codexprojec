"""Internal-only embedding service backed by jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code.

Served via llama.cpp against a Q8_0 GGUF quantization of the model, not raw
PyTorch/HuggingFace `transformers`. That switch is the point of this file:
measured on this exact production host against real source (a 133k-char,
38-chunk flask sample), the previous sentence-transformers/PyTorch backend
hadn't finished the first fifth of the batch after 164s and went on to
OOM-kill the container; llama.cpp finished the same batch in 24.55s (~5,400
chars/s) with no memory blowup. That gap isn't Apple Silicon vs. this host's
CPU (both were checked directly - Accelerate/AMX locally, MKL with full
AVX-512/VNNI here, neither crippled) and it isn't core count (2 threads
performed the same as unconstrained locally). It's llama.cpp's quantized,
hand-tuned CPU kernels against eager-mode PyTorch running an unquantized,
custom `trust_remote_code` model - the same reason nomic-embed-text (served
by Ollama, also llama.cpp underneath) never had this problem. Quantization
cost was checked too: Q8_0 output measured at 0.9997 cosine similarity
against the full-precision PyTorch embedding on the same input.

CPU-only in production (no GPU on these hosts - n_gpu_layers=0 is explicit
below so a build that happens to have GPU support compiled in, e.g. Metal on
a dev machine, doesn't silently take a different code path than prod runs).
The single-text contract remains for scan-worker caches; the additive batch
endpoint is used by hosted index builds so one request can encode many
chunks in one call.

Per-instance locking below is not an optimization - it is required for
correctness. A single `Llama` instance is not safe for concurrent use from
multiple threads (abetlen/llama-cpp-python#1241: concurrent calls into one
context corrupt its internal GGML tensor state), and both routes below are
sync `def` handlers, which FastAPI/Starlette dispatches onto its worker
threadpool rather than the event loop - so two requests arriving close
together genuinely can call into the same `Llama` instance from two
different threads at once. Reproduced directly: profiling a real hosted
index build crashed the container with `GGML_ASSERT(offset + size <=
ggml_nbytes(tensor) && "tensor read out of bounds")` after dozens of
successful requests, on two different corpora (gson after ~33 requests,
apache/thrift after ~38 minutes) - not tied to any one input's size or
content, consistent with a race rather than a bad chunk. This process
serves exactly one shared model to every caller (two scan-worker replicas,
hosted `aletheore index` traffic), so concurrent callers
are the normal case, not an edge case - serializing access to any single
instance is the correct fix, not a workaround.

JINA_EMBED_INSTANCES (default 1, preserving prior single-instance
behavior) loads that many independent Llama instances instead of one,
each with its own lock and 1/N of JINA_EMBED_THREADS. This is not about
using more CPU - the container's total thread budget is unchanged either
way - it's about how that budget is spent. A single instance parallelizing
one embedding call across N threads pays real synchronization/
memory-bandwidth overhead inside llama.cpp's matrix-multiply kernels
(measured well under linear scaling at 2 threads). N single-threaded
instances processing N different requests at once pay none of that: pure
task parallelism, no cross-thread coordination inside one call. It also
directly fixes the serialization side effect of the lock above - today
every caller queues behind one instance even when two scan-worker
replicas or a background /embed cache call and an /embed_batch index
build land at the same moment; multiple instances let genuinely
independent requests actually run at once instead of just avoiding
corruption while still queueing.
