# github-app Changelog

Notable changes to the hosted GitHub App backend (`github-app/`), by deploy date. This is
separate from the root [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md), which tracks versioned releases of the
`aletheore` CLI package in `src/` — the backend has no version number of its own and ships
continuously via pull + rebuild, so its history is tracked here by date instead.

**Convention:** each production deploy is tagged `github-app-deploy-YYYY-MM-DD` (append `-N` for a
second same-day deploy). `git tag -l 'github-app-deploy-*'` gives the full list of deploy points;
`git log <prev-tag>..<tag>` gives the exact commit range for any one of them. For a live,
re-verified snapshot of exactly what's running in production right now, see
[`docs/operations/DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md`](docs/operations/DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md) — this
file is the history; that one is the current state.

**Note:** this file has no entries between 2026-08-28 and 2026-09-06 despite deploys continuing
through that window (tags `github-app-deploy-2026-09-02` through `-09-04` exist) - the rolling
snapshot in `DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md` was kept current each time, but this dated history wasn't.
Not backfilled here; `git log <tag>..<tag>` against the tags above is the authoritative source for
that gap until it is.

## 2026-10-09

Five worker-only deploys, no migrations. `9cf6f24e` (tag `github-app-deploy-2026-10-09-5`) is what the scan
workers, `health-worker` and `scheduler` run now; `app-server` and `jina-embed` stay on `e3182a9f` (no code
under `app_server/` or `jina_embed/` changed). Tags: `github-app-deploy-2026-10-09` (`b3fc4796`, #991:
managed-audit evidence write order, `find_secrets` relative path), `-2` (`b5292bb1`, #995: unused import),
`-3` (`8ef4e232`, #998: a killed parse worker no longer aborts the scan or lets the secret and error-handling
stages report files that were never scanned as clean) and `-4` (`e79f3c73`, #1002: `history_depth_limited`
now reflects what the persisted graph holds, and the in-memory file-hash cache is bounded) and `-5` (`9cf6f24e`, #1007: the semgrep rules now ship in the package; hosted scans keep semgrep off and report "semgrep disabled"). See the snapshot in
`docs/operations/DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md` for what was verified live.

## 2026-10-08

Commit `e3182a9f` (#987), tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-10-08`: 238 commits and 70 merged PRs since
`6e921475` (2026-10-04). One migration, `072_llm_spend_reservations.sql`. All six app services rebuilt
and recreated, including `jina-embed`, with `app-server` rolled first so the migration applied before
the workers ran the new code. Sentry error tracking is live (`SENTRY_DSN` in `.env`). Headlines: the
spend-reservation leak fixes and crash sweep (#917, #918), Flash Review's incremental-mode and
transient-error fixes (#921, #968, #971), a long list of scanner correctness fixes and the large-repo
scan performance work (#985), PMD 7.28.0 for CVE-2026-75140 (#964), and Sentry (#961). See the
snapshot in `docs/operations/DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md` for the grouped list and what was verified live.

## 2026-10-02

Commit `efa1f0e` (#898), no migrations. `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`,
`health-worker` and `scheduler` rebuilt and recreated with the corrected recipe (separate build
and `up -d --no-deps`, no `--scale`). See the "Current Server Snapshot" in
`DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md` for what was verified live.

- **#892 - repo removal.** A removed repo's retained checkout is deleted, and the privacy policy
  now matches that behavior.
- **#893 - top-up and commission currency.** Credit top-ups and affiliate commissions are priced
  in USD, not the checkout currency, so a localized (for example INR) purchase no longer
  mis-credits or mis-pays.
- **#894 - refund alert.** An alert fires when Paddle refunds or charges back a credit top-up.
  Credit already granted is not clawed back automatically.
- **#895 - refund policy.** The site states that refunds are handled by Paddle. Site copy only.
- **#897 - affiliates and annual credit.** Affiliates apply to AIR only (discount codes are
  restricted to the AIR prices), commission is paid on Paddle earnings, and annual AIR subscribers
  get $15 of credit per month instead of $18.
- **#898 - pricing.** Flash is $10/month (`pri_01m3xpabbam5t2gkzwzmg0y9eq`) and credit top-ups are
  $1.15 per $1.00 of credit with tax added on top (`pri_01m3xpabknvke00n5vsxn4wpe0`). The webhook
  still accepts the old $1.00 top-up price so a checkout opened before the swap credits. The old
  $8 Flash price and the old $1.00 top-up price were archived in Paddle after this deploy.

## 2026-10-01

Commit `72ece8d`, no migrations. `app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`
and `scheduler` rebuilt; see the "Current Server Snapshot" in `DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md` for what
was and was not verified live, and for a deploy-recipe correction (do not use `--scale
scan-worker=2`, `scan-worker-2` is its own service).

- **#889 - deterministic scan hardening.** A default-on scanner that was skipped or crashed now
  makes the "Aletheore Deterministic Scan" check neutral instead of a false green. The
  new/resolved split follows file renames. PMD's `CloseResource` rule is no longer blanket-silenced
  and `.repowise` is excluded from scans. Subprocess calls to `git` and the `aletheore` CLI now
  resolve their full executable path first (Bandit B607).
- **#890 - static-analysis check run false failures.** Dismissed static-analysis findings are now
  filtered out of the check run, and a finding whose line moved because of an unrelated edit is
  matched by a content fingerprint instead of being reported as both new and resolved.

## 2026-09-26

Tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-26` (commit `3c09867`), no migrations. One deploy, all five code
services rebuilt and force-recreated.

- **#828 - credit accounting follow-ups.** The `llm_spend` monthly aggregate now records the real
  cost of each call. Reservations only move the credit balance, but the true-up used to record
  `cost - reserve` into the aggregate, driving September to -$156.02 on one install and -$47.20 on
  another (informational table, returned by the admin API as `llm_spend_month_to_date`).
  Flash Review no longer releases its reservation a second time when an error happens after the
  true-up. `_IncrementalSpendBudget` reservations accumulate instead of overwriting, and
  `record_usage` settles against what is actually outstanding, so a second model call under one
  Docs reservation is charged in full.
- One-off data repair after the deploy: the two negative September `llm_spend` rows were reset to
  their `llm_spend_events` ledger sums (1.85 and 2.22).

## 2026-09-25 (later deploys, tags `-2` to `-7`)

Six more deploys the same day, all five code services rebuilt each time, no migrations. Every one
was checked after restart: `/healthz` and the public status API 200, all services `healthy`, zero
errors in the logs, and the change confirmed present inside the running container.

- **`-2` (`a3de1a7`) - dashboard restructure, first half (#819 to #822).** Viewport meta tag on
  every page (it existed nowhere, so phone layouts never worked), then AIRview, Overview (with
  inline credit and seat purchase) and Endpoint health rebuilt to the approved mockups. Adds a
  24-hour uptime figure, the credit allotment and the renewal date to the dashboard data.
- **`-3` (`736bf96`) - dashboard restructure, second half (#823, #824).** Docs (with the
  recently-updated and hotspot panel) and the Flash credits page. The Docs panel adds
  `git.recently_updated` to the AIR schema, so `EVIDENCE_VERSION` went from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0: every
  scan stored at 0.6.0 reads as "no evidence yet" until its repo is scanned again. The two current
  Aletheore repos were re-scanned after the deploy.
- **`-4` (`bcc8124`) - #825.** The sidebar repo list scrolls on its own, so an org with many repos
  no longer pushes Settings and Sign out below the fold.
- **`-5` (`be96d5d`) - #826.** The real Aletheore logo, website wordmark styling and a favicon on
  every dashboard page. The mockups had drawn a placeholder "A" in a box, which had been copied
  into production, and no dashboard page set a favicon.
- **`-6` (`1fb6727`) - #818, sign-in redesign.** Also replaces the sign-in line "We never request
  write access to code", which was false: the GitHub App holds `contents: write`, used only by the
  opt-in, off-by-default Docs sync that pushes `.aletheore/docs/API.md` to an
  `aletheore/docs-update` branch and never to the default branch.
- **`-7` (`9fd724e`) - #827, credit leak.** The Docs build reserved $0.10 per module before it
  knew whether the module needed a model call, and never gave it back when it did not, with no
  `llm_spend_events` row to show for it. Two AIR installs sat at $0.02 and $0.00 with only $1.79
  and $2.22 of ledgered spend. `release_unused_reservation()` now settles it. Also fixed:
  `release_llm_spend_reservation` no longer lowers a base balance that is already above the stored
  allotment (base 18 with allotment 5 lost 13 on the first release).

Data changes made by hand, not part of any deploy: both balances restored after `-7` (Aletheore
allotment and base to $18.00; ArihantK15 base to $18 minus its $2.22 ledgered spend, allotment
$18.00, `balance_epoch` bumped on both). Known and parked: the `Aletheore` installation is on `air`
by a database change and its Paddle customer and subscription ids do not exist in live Paddle, so
its Buy extra seat and Manage billing actions fail until it has a real subscription.

## 2026-09-25

69 commits since the previous deploy (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-23-5`), tagged
`github-app-deploy-2026-09-25` (commit `1d4da1f`), 1 migration (069). All five code services
(`app-server`, `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, `scheduler`) rebuilt and
force-recreated; `jina-embed` unchanged.

Flash Review and credit:

- **Shared per-file PR context is on by default** (kill switch `FLASH_REVIEW_SHARE_PR_CONTEXT=off`).
  Measured on 13 real PRs: +20 points of precision on Flash and +13 on AIR, no recall change.
  Also new: cross-file contradiction check, findings ranked by severity (#793) with id-based
  matching, and a deterministic "Blast radius" section in the review summary.
- **Paid-plan review-count caps removed** (flash 800, air 500): the AI-credit balance is the only
  limit. **AIR's second-model verification pass dropped** and no longer advertised.
- **Standalone AI-credit page** (#800) so Flash customers can see balance and buy credit, with an
  alert email, billing-portal link and a per-PR review history (migration 069,
  `flash_review_history`); alert-email and billing-portal writes need a seat or real GitHub admin
  permission on a repo the installation covers. Stepper for the top-up amount, max 1000.
- **Dashboard theme redesign** and an interactive dependency graph in hosted AIRview.

Fixes found in production the same day:

- **#815 - one minified file blocked the whole repo's durable code graph sync.** The symbol insert
  had no `ON CONFLICT` clause, so two same-name symbols on one line (minified JS) aborted the
  transaction; 36 `UniqueViolation` warnings in 24h on `website/vendor/chart.umd.min.js`.
- **#816 - two false alarms.** `ops_monitor.failed_jobs.<queue>` counted every entry in RQ's
  failed registry (kept a year), so 26 scans that failed Sep 19-23 kept alerting; it now counts only
  failures in the last hour (`ALETHEORE_OPS_FAILED_JOBS_WINDOW_SECONDS`). A `ClientDisconnect` was
  emailed as a bug and counted as a `/webhook` 5xx; it is now logged, answered 499, not counted.
- **#787 - webhook 5xx counter window** (900s to 300s) now live; this is what turned one
  disconnect into a 15-minute-later alert.
- **#811 - privacy policy** now discloses the free-tier LLM providers (Groq, Gemini, OpenAI
  free tier, OpenRouter).
- Also: #785, #786, #788, #789, #790, and Windows CI fixes (#792, #794).

The `Aletheore` installation (147514632) was moved back from `flash` to `air` in the database so
the public status page (endpoint monitoring is AIR-only) reports again. Not part of the code deploy.

## 2026-09-22

4 commits since the previous deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-22` (commit `4abeae9`),
2 migrations (067, 068):

- **#762 - per-file completeness generation + windowed verification for Flash Review.** One real
  LLM generation call per changed file instead of one for the whole PR, fixing PR-Agent's vendored
  "0-5 issues per PR" cap being PR-wide rather than per-file; verification calls now scope to just
  the finding's own file patch instead of the whole PR diff, roughly halving that cost.
- **#751 - hunk-scaled cap, moved-code detection, and identifier grounding for Flash Review.**
- **#750 - audit fixes + 6 deterministic scanners wired into Aletheore** (Semgrep, gosec, Bandit,
  Bearer, Joern, SonarQube) - `security.static_analysis` evidence, normalized findings across every
  tool, dashboard/PR-review/AIRview/MCP consumption.
- **#766 - health-sweep stale-alert false positive fixed**, found live investigating a real report:
  an installation's air -> flash downgrade leaves its `health_check_targets` row in place (by
  design - `list_health_check_targets_all` is AIR-exclusive, a downgrade should stop polling, not
  delete history), but the separate staleness-check job didn't know that, so it re-alerted every 6
  hours indefinitely for a fully-expected state instead of a real outage - confirmed live against
  Aletheore's own dogfood install, whose `endpoint_health` gap had grown to 1 day 15.5 hours before
  this shipped.

## 2026-09-21

2 commits since the previous deploy (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-19-2`), tagged
`github-app-deploy-2026-09-21` (commit `d832130`), no migrations. One real production incident,
reported live and fixed the same session:

- **#752 - the error-alert cooldown never actually worked for any job-dispatched alert.**
  `error_alerts.py`'s `_should_alert()` rate-limited repeated alerts with a plain in-process
  Python dict, on the stated assumption that "process-local and reset on restart" was an
  acceptable tradeoff. It wasn't, for this specific call path: `scan_worker.worker` runs RQ's
  default `Worker` class, which forks a fresh child process for every job - each fork's write to
  that dict died with the fork, so the cooldown never survived past the one job execution that set
  it. `run_health_sweep_staleness_check_job` runs every 180s and calls `send_error_alert` directly
  with no extra guard of its own; with the cooldown structurally non-functional, every tick where
  the underlying staleness condition stayed true re-sent the same alert email from scratch -
  observed live as roughly one email every 3 minutes for 12+ hours. Same root cause a 2026-09-18
  incident already hit once (918 emails from `ops_monitor` before that fix - see `jobs.py`'s
  `_send_ops_alert`), but that fix only added a second, `ops_monitor`-specific Redis-backed
  cooldown in front of the shared mechanism, never fixing the shared mechanism itself. Moved to a
  Redis key with a TTL (the same pooled `get_redis_client()` every other cross-process durable
  check here already uses), atomic across every forked job process and both `scan-worker`
  replicas; fails open (alerts anyway) if Redis itself is unreachable. The underlying staleness
  condition this alert was correctly reporting is a separate, still-open question - live evidence
  (health-worker's sweep completing in ~15-85ms with zero per-target activity) points at zero
  currently-monitored `health_check_targets`, plausibly from an AIR-plan downgrade or a hidden
  repo (`list_health_check_targets_all` filters both out by design) - not confirmed with a direct
  DB read.

## 2026-09-18 (fifth deploy)

8 commits since the fourth 2026-09-18 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-18-5` (commit
`f37cd98`), one migration (066). A backward-audit sweep of recently-touched hotspots, plus two
real self-findings Aletheore's own Flash Review surfaced on its own merged PRs the same night:

- **#738 - the crash-alert dedup key now uses a matched route's TEMPLATE**, not the fully-
  instantiated URL - a follow-up to the earlier same-night #734 fix. Several real routes here take
  path params (`dashboard.py`'s `{org}/{repo}`, `managed_audit_api.py`'s `{job_id}`/
  `{verification_token}`, and `{file_path:path}`, user-controllable free text); `error_alerts.py`'s
  dedup store is a plain, never-evicted, process-lifetime dict keyed by this exact string, so
  keying by the instantiated URL would have minted one new permanent entry per distinct org/repo/
  job/file that ever errors - an unbounded leak for the life of the process instead of the single
  bounded entry per route #734 intended.
- **#739 - 8 more `splitlines()` vs `split("\n")` line-indexing fixes**, the same real bug class
  fixed twice earlier this session (#707, #711): `splitlines()` also breaks on `\v`, `\f`,
  `\x1c`-`\x1e`, NEL, LS, and PS, none of which git or GitHub ever treat as a line boundary, so
  indexing a real `\n`-based line number into a `splitlines()`-produced list silently targets the
  wrong content the moment one of those characters appears anywhere earlier in the file. Landed
  across `scan_worker/jobs.py`, `semantic_checks.py`, and `src/aletheore/query.py`/`search_index.py`
  - the last two mean this also affects `aletheore symbol-source` and the MCP server's own
  `aletheore_symbol_source` tool, not just Flash Review.
- **#743 - one real sibling site #739's own sweep missed**: `live_docs.py`'s `_symbol_snippet`
  (reached via `scan_worker/jobs.py`'s `_run_docs_build_for_modules`) hit the identical bug -
  found by independently grepping every remaining `.splitlines()` call in the codebase after #739
  merged, not by trusting its "N more sibling sites" count.
- **#740 - the health-check fix-suggestion cooldown now only burns on a real, delivered
  suggestion**, not on every attempt. `_fix_suggestion_attachment` has several ordinary reasons to
  return `None` (credit balance exhausted, spend budget exhausted, file content fetch failed, the
  LLM call itself raised, or it returned "unknown") - each of those used to burn the same cooldown
  a real suggestion would have, so a customer whose endpoint stayed down could get zero real
  suggestions for the full cooldown window with no retry until it expired.
- **#741 - double-click guards added to `buySeat`/`removeSeat`/`generateToken`**, the only
  button-triggered actions on the settings page with no disabled-during-request guard - a second
  click landing before the first response came back fired a second, genuinely separate real-money
  POST (the backend's per-installation lock only serializes the two requests, it doesn't collapse
  them into one purchase).
- **#742 - two orphaned-PII gaps closed in account-deletion purge** (migration 066):
  `sent_emails.installation_id` was `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so a deleted customer's real email
  address survived a purge with just the FK column nulled out; `pending_subscription_claims.
  claimed_by_installation_id` had no `ON DELETE` clause at all, which would have made the purge
  itself crash with a `ForeignKeyViolation` on any referencing row. Both now `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- **#744 - two real gaps Aletheore's own Flash Review found on #739 and #741 after they'd already
  merged**, posted as grounded inline findings rather than a generic "no issues" pass: (1)
  `_fetch_line_count`'s `content.count("\n") + 1` over-counted by one for any file ending in a
  trailing newline (the common case) - a citation exactly one past a file's true end wrongly
  passed `verify_citations`' bounds check, the same failure mode the original fix existed to
  close, from the opposite direction; (2) `generateToken`/`buySeat`/`removeSeat`'s new double-click
  guard only re-enabled its button on the explicit HTTP-error branch and the success path - a
  genuine network failure (`fetch()` itself rejecting) left a real-money action's button stuck
  disabled forever with no recovery short of a full page reload. Both fixes proven to fail against
  the pre-fix code before being confirmed fixed, not just asserted correct.

## 2026-09-18 (fourth deploy)

1 commit since the third 2026-09-18 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-18-4` (commit
`ae8e319`), no migrations:

- **#734 - a webhook-handler crash now actually alerts, and a real cross-route bug that was
  suppressing that alert is fixed.** `/webhook` can only ever produce a 5xx one way: an unhandled
  exception reaching `app_server.main`'s `handle_unexpected_exception`, which already called
  `send_error_alert` - but that call's dedup key was a bare `"app_server"` plus exception type,
  not scoped by route, with a process-local (in-memory) 6-hour cooldown. Any unrelated exception of
  the same type anywhere else in `app_server` within that window would silently eat the `/webhook`
  alert too, and a container restart wipes the log evidence needed to even notice. Real incident
  this closes out: PR #727 (earlier the same night) sat merged with zero Flash Review activity for
  ~18 hours because its "opened" webhook hit exactly this - a genuine crash (most likely the
  already-fixed `_dead_code_context` sort-on-dict bug, #729) that produced no alert anywhere and no
  surviving traceback once the container recycled. Fixed two ways: `send_error_alert`'s source is
  now scoped by path (`app_server:/webhook` instead of bare `app_server`), closing the
  cross-route suppression; and a new durable Redis counter (`record_webhook_5xx`,
  `app_server/redis_client.py`) increments on every `/webhook` 5xx and survives a restart, read by
  a new `ops_monitor` check (`_check_webhook_errors`, `scan_worker/jobs.py`) using the exact same
  threshold/duration/cooldown shape as the existing queue-depth and failed-jobs checks. Independently
  re-verified before merge: the dedup-key collision was traced by hand against `send_error_alert`'s
  real logic, the new check's wiring matches the established `ops_monitor` pattern exactly, and the
  new end-to-end test (`test_webhook_crash_records_durable_5xx_counter_and_scopes_alert_source`)
  exercises the real `/webhook` route through a simulated crash rather than mocking the function
  under test.

## 2026-09-18 (third deploy)

2 commits since the second 2026-09-18 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-18-3` (commit
`6ebe04f`), no migrations. #733 was a docs-only carryover from the prior deploy; #735 is the real
change:

- **#735 - Flash Review no longer drops a changed file over MAX_CONTEXT_FILE_BYTES (100KB)
  outright.** `fetch_review_file_context`'s old behavior made an oversized file invisible not just
  to the prompt but to `_line_citation_content_matches`'s citation check too (which passes any
  finding whose file content it doesn't have) - confirmed live on #734 the same night:
  `scan_worker/jobs.py`, this repo's own biggest and highest-churn file, was silently excluded from
  its own PR's review, "No issues found" reported having genuinely never looked at it. Given real
  diff-hunk evidence, an oversized file now gets a windowed excerpt instead: real content survives
  within `FILE_WINDOW_MARGIN_LINES` (30) of anything the diff touched (reusing the existing
  `_patch_valid_lines` helper for line accounting), everything else becomes a blank filler line -
  which preserves every kept line's real absolute line number for free, so the citation check's
  existing `content.split("\n")[line]` indexing needed zero changes to work against a windowed file
  exactly as it does a full one, and costs about a byte per blanked line even for a huge file.
  `MAX_CONTEXT_FILE_BYTES`/`MAX_CONTEXT_FILES` (`github_api.py`) stayed untouched - real, cost-tuned
  values against the $6/mo Flash plan cap; this works within them rather than raising them. Also
  removed `fetch_review_file_context`'s second return value, a formatted "file_context" prompt
  blob that PR-Agent's real prompt (#730) has no slot for and whose one caller discarded unread the
  moment that prompt shipped - dead computation on every single review, found and removed rather
  than windowed alongside the real fix. Independently re-verified by a second session (full
  repo-wide grep confirming no other caller of the removed return value or removed imports, and a
  from-scratch trace of the windowing index math) before merge.

## 2026-09-18

18 commits since the 2026-09-13 second deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-18` (commit
`8c7c9e6`), no migrations. Two headline changes plus dependency bumps and a benchmark/marketing
cleanup batch that had been sitting merged but undeployed:

- **#730 - Flash Review's generation model swapped from Luna to GLM-5.3-Flash on IndieRouter, and
  its system prompt rewritten around PR-Agent's vendored review prompt** (MIT-licensed,
  github.com/the-pr-agent/pr-agent) plus 6 condensed Aletheore-specific safety rules, replacing the
  prior bespoke prompt entirely. This followed a full night of benchmarking across prompt variants
  and models on the 50-PR full corpus, landing on PR-Agent's prompt + GLM-5.3-Flash + temperature
  0.2 + reasoning_effort low as the best-scoring combination (60.4% avg F1, 56.3-62.6% range across
  runs). `flash_review_generation_adapter()` (`scan_worker/model_tiers.py`) falls back to
  DeepSeek-v4-flash when `INDIEROUTER_API_KEY` isn't configured or OpenAI isn't available -
  requires that key to be present in `github-app/.env` for the swap to actually take effect, which
  this deploy also added. One real bug was caught and fixed before shipping: the free-tier
  fallback-chain validator in `flash_review.py` checked for a JSON-array response shape, which
  would have permanently broken every free-tier review under PR-Agent's YAML output format - fixed
  via a shared `_extract_pr_agent_yaml_issues()` helper. A second real bug was caught by an
  independent peer review: `flash_review_generation_adapter`'s fallback path hardcoded the GLM
  model name into the DeepSeek adapter constructor in the no-IndieRouter-AND-no-OpenAI case,
  building an invalid adapter - fixed with an explicit `fallback_model` parameter. A third finding
  from that same peer review (PR-Agent's vendored prompt describes a `__new hunk__`/`__old hunk__`
  diff format that `_build_flash_review_user_prompt` never actually sends) was investigated rather
  than assumed away: stripping the mismatched paragraph and re-validating on the full corpus showed
  a real, consistent ~5-point regression (55.4% avg F1), so it was reverted and the dead end
  documented in a code comment. Verification (`VERIFICATION_MODEL`, hardcoded to
  `deepseek-v4-flash`), AIRview's writing adapter, and Docs generation are all untouched by this
  change - confirmed unaffected by direct code inspection, and separately confirmed by a real
  head-to-head accuracy test (see below) that GLM-5.3-Flash should *not* also replace DeepSeek as
  the verification model despite outperforming it on writing/generation tasks.
- **#729 - fixed a real, live production crash**: `_dead_code_context()`
  (`scan_worker/airview_scanner_context.py`) called `sorted()` directly on
  `unused_dependencies` entries, which `src/aletheore/dead_code.py` always emits as dicts
  (`{"ecosystem", "package"}`), never plain strings - every existing test had assumed the string
  shape, so nothing caught it before it hit prod. Root-caused via a live SSH investigation of a
  recurring `ops_monitor.failed_jobs.scans` alert: traced from two stale RQ `FailedJobRegistry`
  entries (dated 2026-09-14) that were re-triggering the alert on every check even though nothing
  new was failing, through to the actual unguarded `TypeError` inside `live_wiki.generate_file_pages`
  → `build_repo_context` → `_dead_code_context`. Fixed by normalizing dict entries to strings
  before sorting, with two new regression tests covering both the real production shape and a
  malformed-dict fallback.
- **#724, #725, #726 - Java/Go coverage added to `semantic_checks.py`'s deterministic layer**
  (gated by file extension, with block-comment stripping), plus a fix for
  `run_model_comparison.py` silently feeding raw git diffs to `review_diff()` and disabling every
  deterministic check in the benchmark harness itself.
- **#711, #713, #714, #716, #717 - a round of real Flash Review recall/citation fixes** found via
  the same benchmarking push: a prompt change that was suppressing recall specifically on
  lightweight models, a missing file-context grant for the second-model verifier, a whole-repo-tree
  dump breaking three benchmark competitors' own harnesses, an indexing bug in
  `_line_citation_content_matches` (`str.splitlines()` instead of real `\n` lines - could silently
  misalign line numbers after a stray control character), and a new deterministic check for a
  dropped closing quote in an edited message.
- **#712, #723 - benchmark/marketing cleanup**: dropped Bito and Korbit from the PR-review
  benchmark, removed an unsubstantiated PR-Agent head-to-head marketing claim.
- Dependency bumps: anyio 4.15.0→4.15.1, numpy 2.5.2→2.5.3, cspell 10.2.2→10.3.0,
  github/codeql-action/upload-sarif.
- **Operational note:** prod had drifted 18 commits / 5 days behind master before this deploy
  (last deployed 2026-09-13). `INDIEROUTER_API_KEY` was added to prod's `github-app/.env` as part
  of this deploy - previously absent, which would have made #730's GLM swap silently no-op to the
  DeepSeek/OpenAI fallback path.

## 2026-09-18 (second deploy)

3 commits since the first 2026-09-18 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-18-2` (commit
`a1fc995`), no migrations. All three had been merged before the first deploy of the day but missed
that build - a straight audit-findings batch closing real gaps in `semantic_checks.py`'s
deterministic layer plus one uncovered benchmark-script test file:

- **#727 - 3 real gaps closed in the Java semantic checks**, found auditing #724-#726's own
  changes rather than assuming they were complete: exception-type matching compared
  fully-qualified `throws` clauses (as a referenced-definition snippet renders them) against
  unqualified `catch` types (as real Java code overwhelmingly writes them via an import) by exact
  string equality, silently missing genuinely-removed handlers - now compared by simple name. The
  defensive-copy-removal check only verified some `new ArrayList<>(x)` assignment was removed and
  the same raw variable reached the call, never that the removed code actually passed the copy to
  that call - a real false positive where an unrelated removed copy (kept for a separate audit
  log) coincidentally shared a variable name with the call's own argument. And the empty-catch
  block-comment tracker unconditionally consumed a comment's closing `*/` line whole, so a comment
  ending on the same line as the catch's own closing `}` (`... */ }`) left the block looking
  unclosed and silently dropped the finding.
- **#732 - the Go shell-injection check missed full-path `sh`/`bash` invocations**, found in a
  reverse-audit of #725/#726: `_GO_SHELL_CALL_RE` only matched the bare `"sh"`/`"bash"` literal, so
  `exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", ...)` - at least as common in real Go code as the bare name, since
  `os/exec` resolves a bare name via `PATH` at call time and many callers avoid relying on that -
  went undetected. Fixed by allowing an optional path prefix before the basename, verified by hand
  (not just by the new tests) that this doesn't widen into a substring match: a binary whose name
  merely contains "sh" (e.g. `"fish"`) still can't match, because the prefix group requires a
  trailing literal `/` to consume anything, which `"fish"` never has.
- **#728 - test coverage added for `run_model_comparison.py`'s diff-parsing functions**, covering
  the real bug #724 fixed in the same area (the script feeding git-header-included diff text
  straight into `review_diff()`/`find_semantic_regressions()`, which silently zeroed out every
  deterministic check the benchmark harness ran).

**Note:** #727 sat merged but unreviewed by Flash Review for ~18 hours before this deploy - its
"opened" webhook delivery got a synchronous HTTP 500 from `app_server` at the time (confirmed via
GitHub's own `/app/hook/deliveries` history), most likely the `_dead_code_context` sort-on-dict
crash #729 fixed the same day, and the original container logs were gone by the time this was
found (recycled by the first 2026-09-18 deploy's rebuild). Redelivering that exact webhook against
today's code completed cleanly end-to-end. The underlying gap - a webhook-handler 5xx produces no
alert anywhere, only a silently-missing review - is tracked as a follow-up, not yet fixed.

## 2026-09-13 (second deploy)

6 commits since the first 2026-09-13 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-13-2` (commit
`47ee0ab`), no migrations. Two substantive changes plus a version bump and a docs-only PR
recording the first deploy of the day:

- **#707 - Flash Review suggestions now render as real, one-click GitHub "Suggested change"
  blocks** instead of an inert plain code fence, closing a real gap found by installing 4
  benchmark competitors on a scratch repo and comparing output side by side (Sourcery already
  rendered a clickable suggestion for a bug ours only described in prose). Because GitHub's
  suggestion feature does a literal, unreviewed text substitution the instant someone clicks
  Apply, this shipped with defense in depth rather than a single mechanical check: `flash_review.py`'s
  `_clickable_suggestion` gate requires an exact single-line match to a real diff line, re-indents
  deterministically rather than trusting the model's own whitespace, rejects a no-op or a
  suspiciously-similar-but-wrong-line match (`SequenceMatcher` similarity gate), and confirms the
  substitution parses cleanly via tree-sitter before ever considering it - two real bugs were
  found and fixed against real, non-mocked model output before merge (indentation reliably
  omitted despite the prompt asking for it; a suggestion matching a *different* real line's own
  text passing every check until the no-op/similarity gate existed) plus one critical bug an
  independent adversarial peer review caught: indexing by `str.splitlines()` instead of `"\n"`
  could silently misalign every line number after a stray `\v`/`\f`/NEL/LS/PS character earlier in
  the file, validating and "correcting" the wrong line entirely. On top of the mechanical gate, a
  second, adversarially-framed `deepseek-v4-flash` call (`_verify_suggestion_correctness`) now
  independently judges whether the exact one-line replacement is semantically correct before
  `suggestion_clickable` is ever set true - added specifically because tree-sitter's parse check
  catches syntax errors, never a confidently-wrong single-token flip (an inverted boolean, an
  off-by-one comparison, an equality flip) of the same shape as a correct fix. Runs on both Flash
  and AIR (deliberately not coupled to the AIR-only grounding recheck - Flash's solo-Luna
  generation already skips dual-agent verification, making it *more* exposed to this risk, not
  less) but explicitly excluded for free tier via a new `verify_suggestions` flag, since it always
  calls a real, non-free model and the existing `on_verification_usage` cost callback carries a
  documented "never called for free tier" assumption that would otherwise have been silently
  broken. A second peer-review pass on this layer itself found one more real gap before merge:
  `_verify_suggestion_correctness` touched `finding["issue"]`/`["file"]`/`["line"]`/`["suggestion"]`
  and indexed the file's lines *before* its own try/except, so a malformed finding could crash the
  whole batch (via the ThreadPoolExecutor's `pool.map()`) instead of failing closed on just that
  one suggestion - fixed by moving the entire body inside the try block.
- **#708 - the aletheore MCP server's instructions now ask agents to file a GitHub issue** on a
  genuine tool-side gap (a call failing unexpectedly, results clearly wrong against the codebase's
  real state, a documented capability not working as described) rather than silently working
  around it - scoped to exclude user error, with a dedup check and a concrete-repro requirement so
  a filed issue is actually actionable.
- **#703/#704** - `aletheore` 0.9.17 released to PyPI (unrelated to this backend, ships
  independently via its own OIDC-trusted-publish workflow); `#704` recorded the first 2026-09-13
  deploy in this file after the fact.

All six services rebuilt and force-recreated; confirmed healthy via `docker compose ps` (all
`healthy`) and zero errors/`no pending migrations` in `app-server`'s logs since restart. Both
substantive fixes confirmed present in the *running* containers' actual source via
`inspect.getsource` - not re-read from the repo: `scan-worker` shows
`SUGGESTION_CORRECTNESS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and a `verify_suggestions` parameter on `review_diff`, with
the try/except now wrapping `finding["file"]` access in `_verify_suggestion_correctness`;
`app-server` shows the new issue-reporting paragraph, including the real
`github.com/Aletheore/Aletheore/issues` URL, in `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS`. The website (`#706`, a
copy-only fix correcting an "open source" claim to "source-available") deploys independently via
Vercel's own git integration and was separately confirmed live at `www.aletheore.com` - not part
of this docker stack at all.

## 2026-09-13

Eight commits since the 2026-09-11 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-13` (commit
`4a5d808`), no migrations. **#688 - push webhook silently capped the compare-API's changed-files
list at 300**: a monorepo push touching more files than that would silently drop the rest from
dead-code/endpoint re-scanning, with no error or log line - fixed to paginate through the full
comparison instead of trusting the API's own truncation flag alone. **#689 - Flash Review's own
grounding miscounted lines around a `\ No newline at end of file` marker**: git's own diff marker
line was mishandled in `_patch_valid_lines`, producing phantom valid-line entries and shifted line
numbers in citation grounding - a real, if narrow, source of the bot's own false
resolved/unresolved verdicts. **#690 - concurrent scans of the same repo could lose git graph
store updates**: an unlocked read-modify-write in `postgres_graph_store.py` let two scan-worker
replicas racing on the same repo silently drop one side's edges; closed with a Postgres advisory
lock. **#692 - GitHub OAuth code-exchange failure surfaced as a raw 500 + alert email**: GitHub's
`/login/oauth/access_token` returns HTTP 200 with an `{"error": ...}` body (never a 4xx) for an
invalid/expired/reused code - the refresh-token grant already handled this exact quirk, the
code-exchange grant didn't, so every one of these failures paged as an unhandled exception instead
of a clean redirect back to `/auth/login`. **#695 - `fetch_pr_diff`/`fetch_pr_changed_files`
silently capped at 300 files**, the same class of gap as #688 on the PR-review path instead of the
push path. **#700 - `semantic_checks.py`'s except-body-weakened check missed cases past a
`\ No newline at end of file` marker** - the same root cause as #689, in a second consumer of the
same patch-parsing helper. **#701 - a managed-audit cooldown was burned even when the
installation's credit balance was already exhausted**, wasting the installation's next real
cooldown window on a run that was rejected before it started. **#702 - removed the entire GitHub
Marketplace webhook path** (`webhooks/marketplace.py`, its route, its tests): no Marketplace
listing for Aletheore has ever existed (confirmed live - `github.com/marketplace/aletheore` 404s,
the App's own page has no pricing/plans link at all), so `handle_marketplace_event` could never
fire in production; it was speculative scaffolding from the App's original foundation commit,
kept alive across several later audit passes without anyone questioning reachability, and it
carried a real, now-moot gap (never initializing the new `base_credit_remaining_usd` column the
in-flight dollar-credit-pricing work depends on).

All six services rebuilt and force-recreated (`app-server`, `scan-worker`/`scan-worker-2`/
`health-worker`/`scheduler` share one image, `jina-embed` unchanged in behavior but rebuilt with
the rest); confirmed healthy via `docker ps` and `/healthz` (both the container-internal check and
the public `app.aletheore.com` endpoint), zero errors in `app-server`'s logs since restart, and
each fix above confirmed present in the *running* containers' actual source via
`inspect.getsource` - not re-read from the repo - checking for a marker specific to each: the
absence of `webhooks.marketplace` as an importable module (#702), `GitHubOAuthError` in `auth.py`
(#692), `fetch_pr_changed_files` in `pull_request.py`/`push.py` (#695/#688), `"No newline at end
of file"` in `flash_review.py`/`semantic_checks.py` (#689/#700), `advisory` in
`postgres_graph_store.py` (#690), and `exhausted`+`cooldown` co-occurring in `jobs.py` (#701).

## 2026-09-11

Four commits since the third 2026-09-10 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-11` (commit
`6451c41`) - four real bug fixes to the dollar-credit-pricing system and AIRview caching, no
migrations. **#656 - out-of-order Paddle webhook could reset a newer period's credit back to a
stale allotment**: `subscription.updated` events aren't guaranteed to arrive in send order: a
renewal-reset webhook that arrives after a later top-up or usage event could overwrite the
installation's already-current balance with the allotment computed from its own, now-stale,
`current_billing_period_start`. Fixed by comparing the incoming period start against the stored
one and only resetting when the incoming period is strictly newer. **#657 - Flash Review's own
true-up path never drained balance on insufficient overage**: `_IncrementalSpendBudget.record_usage`
already drained the balance to zero on a *failed* `reserve_llm_spend` call, but its own
`ledger_cost_usd` true-up branch - the "overage" case where the final real cost is more than what
was reserved up front - called `release_llm_spend_reservation` with a negative delta and never
checked whether the release itself succeeded, silently leaving a truthful balance behind a job that
had actually run over. Fixed by applying the same failed-release drain-to-zero fallback there.
**#658 - cancelling an annual AIR subscription never disarmed the monthly credit clock**: the
synthetic `next_monthly_credit_reset_at` clock added for annual AIR subscribers (so they still get
a monthly credit refill despite a yearly billing cycle) was only ever set, never cleared - a
cancelled annual installation kept ticking and would still receive a free monthly top-up
indefinitely. Fixed by clearing the column on `subscription.canceled`. **#659 - AIRview's
single-target write path never cached its own output**: `live_wiki`'s single-file regeneration path
(triggered by a PR touching one already-documented symbol) wrote the freshly generated page to
storage but never wrote it into the same in-process cache the read path checks first, so the very
next request for that page - even one arriving milliseconds later - recomputed it from scratch
instead of hitting the page this job had just built. Fixed by writing through to the cache on the
same path the bulk-regeneration job already used. Both Docker images changed - `app-server` for
fixes #656 and #658, the shared `scan-worker` image for fixes #657 and #659, which also backs
`scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, and `scheduler` - so all five services were rebuilt and
force-recreated; all four
fixes confirmed present in the running containers' actual source before calling this deploy done.

## 2026-09-10

25 commits since the previous deploy (`github-app-deploy-2026-09-08-2`, tagged
`github-app-deploy-2026-09-10`, commit `ee927c8`) - headlined by the dollar-credit pricing launch,
plus an independent 10-PR hardening/feature batch and one cost-focused cleanup.

- **Dollar-credit pricing goes live** (#645, #646, #647): replaces the flat `PLAN_CAP_OVERRIDE_USD`
  LLM-spend ceiling with a real per-installation balance - `base_credit_remaining_usd` (resets every
  billing-period renewal to $5/flash or $18/air + $3/extra seat) plus `topup_credit_balance_usd`
  (never-expiring, customer-purchased top-up credit at $1/unit via a real live Paddle price,
  `pri_01m23jw9qbsnm4zmv28bfebx4t`). Four new migrations (`062`-`065`): the per-feature LLM spend
  ledger, the credit-balance columns + backfill, a `base_credit_allotment_usd` ceiling (closing a
  critical bug a fix-wave re-review caught - true-up releases were leaking monthly base credit into
  never-expiring top-up credit), and a synthetic monthly reset clock for annual AIR subscribers
  (Paddle's own billing period only advances once a year for them, so without this they'd get their
  $18 once for the whole year instead of refreshed monthly - fires via a new scheduled sweep,
  `run_monthly_credit_reset_sweep_job`, added to the existing scheduler tick). A dedicated dashboard
  Usage section, buy-more-credit flow, and low-balance/exhausted email templates ship alongside it.
  Also closes a real bug a peer session caught independently: credit top-up purchases were paying
  15% affiliate commission on near-zero-margin pass-through spend (#645's own commit), and a
  follow-up audit found a devtools-crafted checkout could bundle a top-up with another line item to
  get over-credited for the combined total (#647).
- **LLM cost cleanup** (#648): Flash Review's prompt now puts the diff last instead of first, so
  provider-side prompt caching (DeepSeek, OpenAI) can actually hit on the shared evidence-context
  prefix - confirmed live in prod logs before this fix that Luna's Flash Review calls were landing
  zero cache hits over 24h while DeepSeek's AIRview calls (same underlying mechanism, different
  prompt ordering) were hitting >95% on some calls. Also right-sizes `_IncrementalSpendBudget`'s
  reserve for 5 previously-mis-sized call sites (managed_audit, health_fix_suggestion,
  airview_incremental, docs_incremental - still on the old near-zero placeholder) and dedupes a
  redundant `embed_text` round-trip between a cache miss and its own write-back.
- **Independent 10-PR batch** (#606-#644, excluding the dollar-credit-pricing commits above):
  Paddle webhook null/string seat-quantity crash (#609), ChatOps trigger-phrase false positives
  (#610), a UTC-midnight Redis key bug in OpenAI free-tier reservation true-ups (#611), a false
  latency alert on `latency_threshold_ms<=0` (#612), embedding_client accepting NaN/Infinity/bool as
  a valid embedding (#623), stale Flash Review cache hits on findings the verifier had already
  rejected (#625), AIRview permanently blanking a file newly joining a subsystem cluster (#626),
  health-check rows blending across targets (#628), two symbols sharing a name corrupting each
  other's Docs description (#630), AIRview's infrastructure-context truncation gap (#633), a
  swallowed-exception check blind spot (#634), the durable per-feature LLM spend ledger (#635, the
  foundation migration `062` for this deploy's own credit-ledger work), a diff-corrupting
  "no newline at EOF" marker bug (#636), a regression-risk check-run mislabeling incidents as
  production (#638), Pushover alert delivery silently skipping on failure (#640), repo_history
  retention starving queued incremental updates (#641), and stale Live Docs/Wiki pages surviving a
  deleted symbol or cluster (#643, #644).

Full per-PR detail in each PR's own description; this entry summarizes rather than duplicates it.

## 2026-09-10 (second deploy)

One commit since the first 2026-09-10 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-10-2` (commit
`f8b2f36`) - a small, real UI fix on the just-shipped dollar-credit dashboard (#651), caught from a
live screenshot of the deployed settings page: `.settings-grid` defaulted to `align-items:
stretch`, so the shorter Team/API tokens column was force-stretched to match the taller
Alert-channels/Endpoint-health/Managed-audit column, leaving a large visible gap before the Usage
section - fixed with `align-items: start`. Separately, `buyCredit()`'s "Opening checkout..." status
text never updated again after `Paddle.Checkout.open()`, since `Paddle.Initialize()` had no
`eventCallback` - added one that clears the status once the overlay loads, shows success on
`checkout.completed`, clears on `checkout.closed` (unless a purchase just completed), and surfaces
a real message on `checkout.error`.

## 2026-09-10 (third deploy)

One commit since the second 2026-09-10 deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-10-3` (commit
`428e8fd`) - a real follow-up fix to #651's own fix (#654): the `align-items: start` change did not
actually work, as a post-deploy screenshot showed. Root cause of the miss: `.settings-grid` has
exactly one implicit grid row (two wrapper divs, one row), and automatic row-track sizing is based
on each item's content height regardless of `align-items` - that property only repositions a
*shorter* item within an already-tall row, it doesn't shrink the row itself, so the row height
still matched the taller column no matter what. Switching to CSS multi-column (`columns: 2`) was
tried and rejected too: "Alert channels" alone (Slack/Teams + Email + Pushover forms, ~430px)
outweighs the other four cards combined, and multi-column can only pick a split point in DOM order,
not reorder content, so it converges on the same lopsided split. The fix that actually works: move
"Managed audit content" into the left column (with Team/API tokens) instead of the right (with
Alert channels/Endpoint health targets) - the best 2-way partition of the five cards by rendered
height, cutting the empty gap from ~400px to ~50px. Verified this time with a real headless-Chrome
render of the actual extracted `loadSettings()` markup before shipping, not a hand-typed
approximation.

## 2026-09-08

12 commits since the previous deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-08` (commit `fd7c2c3`) -
a 10-PR hardening pass (backward-audit findings against recently merged PRs) plus one new feature:

- **Two real regressions caught and fixed before merge, not shipped** - both by Flash Review's own
  dogfooded review of the fix PRs themselves: `_class_name_and_superclass` (#580, Rails
  model-association clustering) gave up on an entire file if its first class definition lacked a
  superclass, instead of trying the next sibling class. `airview_scanner_context.py`'s new
  truncation caps (#586) had 5 real issues - 4 sort keys that weren't fully deterministic on ties,
  and one genuine `TypeError` crash risk from sorting a list that could mix dicts and strings.
- **A real, live spend-leak closed** (#583): a cache-hit Flash Review recheck bypassed the
  AIR-tier verification gate entirely, silently giving free-tier installations a paid-only
  DeepSeek verification call on any cache hit with an unquotable finding.
- **`db_column=""` truthiness bug** (#587): `db_column or field_name` treated an explicit empty
  string as if `db_column` had never been given at all - found via Flash Review's own review.
- **Other real fixes**: `require.resolve('pkg')` never recognized as an import (#581); a Django
  unsupported-op catch-all fabricated a `migrations.` prefix regardless of the call's real receiver
  (#582); `RunSQL`/`op.execute`/`execute` with a non-literal SQL argument silently vanished instead
  of being flagged unsupported (#585); the endpoint-health dashboard never disclosed its
  64-endpoint monitoring cap (#588); inconsistent headroom-percentage math in a comment, and
  Groq's real TPM limit recorded inline (#579).
- **New feature, with a real migration** (#590): customers can now explicitly choose which
  endpoints get health-checked once a repo has more than the 64-endpoint cap, instead of Aletheore
  silently picking the first 64 in scan order. `scan_worker.jobs.rank_endpoints_by_selection` is
  the single shared ranking function both the real sweep and the admin dashboard route call, so
  the two can never silently drift apart. Migration `060_endpoint_health_selection.sql` adds the
  new table. Includes a self-review follow-up fix (a `candidate_count` vs `total_endpoint_count`
  bug in the "still capped" dashboard message). Originally PR #589 stacked on #588's branch -
  GitHub auto-closed it when that branch was deleted post-squash-merge, so it was recreated as
  #590 targeting master directly.

No other DB migrations in this range beyond #590's.

## 2026-09-08 (second deploy)

14 commits since the previous deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-08-2` (commit `a6e2457`) -
a second, independent 10-PR hardening pass (a fresh adversarial audit round) plus one product
removal:

- **Real fixes from the audit batch**: a Rails `reversible do |dir|` block's `dir.down` was read
  as forward-migration code (#593); Go/Rust/Java/C# compiled-language entry points always looked
  unreachable to dead-code detection (#594); the secret scanner missed `SECRET_KEY`/`*_TOKEN`
  assignments entirely (#595); a Flash Review hunk-scope correction fired a self-contradictory
  false positive on every Python class-header hunk (#596); Gin route groups silently dropped their
  `.Group()` prefix (#597); the repo's own license went undetected for Rust/PHP/Ruby/C#/Java
  (#598); a Maven `pom.xml` with no declared `xmlns` was invisible to vulnerability scanning
  (#599); JVM co-located test files (`FooTest.kt` beside `Foo.kt`) were invisible to test-path
  detection (#600); evidence resolution misattributed commits by whole-file recency and dropped
  risk findings on a package-name mismatch (#601); `aletheore_ast_pattern` ignored
  `.aletheore.json` exclusions and `mcp-install` could follow a symlink out of the repo (#603); a
  nested/nonstandard build-tool Dockerfile and Symfony's `.env.dist` convention were both invisible
  to detection (#602).
- **5 real regressions caught and fixed before merge, not shipped** - each PR's own Flash Review
  inline findings were checked against the real diff rather than trusted or ignored: the
  `dir.down` exclusion matched any receiver's `.down()` call, not just a real `reversible` block's
  (#593); three compiled-language entry-point regexes were simultaneously too loose (Rust matched
  a nested `fn main` inside `mod tests`) and too strict (Java's modifier order, C#'s cross-line
  static+Main) (#594); a gemspec license regex matched commented-out assignments (#598); Maven
  namespace-stripping removed every `{uri}` prefix, not just Maven's own, so a foreign-namespaced
  plugin config block could be parsed as real dependency metadata (#599); the Gin group-prefix
  binding table was keyed file-wide instead of per function scope, so two functions reusing the
  idiomatic "v1" group-variable name bled into each other's routes (#597).
- **One Flash Review finding checked and dismissed, not fixed blind** (#601): a claimed git-blame
  `^` boundary-commit marker in `--porcelain` output was tested against real git 2.52.0 across both
  documented trigger cases (a root commit, a shallow clone) and did not reproduce - porcelain mode
  never emits the marker, only the plain default format does.
- **Product removal, with a real migration** (#605): the public, unauthenticated "paste a repo"
  website demo was removed entirely - its own RQ worker, Docker-socket-holding sidecar, three
  Dockerfiles, docker-compose services, and website form. The free CLI already covers what it
  offered, and it was the only unauthenticated internet-facing attack surface in the system (this
  same session's own audit had just found a real crash bug in it, #604, closed as superseded by
  the removal). Migration `061_drop_demo_scan_rate_limits.sql` drops the now-orphaned table (no FK
  referenced it, IP+timestamp rate-limit state only). Independently re-verified before merging:
  repo-wide grep for zero remaining references, the migration's safety, the CORS-narrowing change
  against `website/status.js`'s real cross-origin call, and both test suites run locally
  (1779/1779 `src`, 1742 passed + 8 skipped `github-app`, matching the PR's own claims exactly) -
  one real gap found and fixed before merge: the root `README.md` still described `website/` as
  carrying "the marketing site and live demo", missed by a literal demo-scan/demo-sandbox string
  search since it names neither.
- **Deploy sequencing note**: the demo-scan-worker/demo-sandbox/demo-sandbox-runner containers
  were manually removed from production *before* this redeploy (closing the Docker-socket attack
  surface immediately), leaving a short window where the still-running old app-server accepted
  `POST /v1/demo-scan` (returning `202`, silently orphaned - no worker left to process it) until
  this redeploy replaced it with code that returns `404` for the same request. Confirmed live with
  real requests against the endpoint on both sides of the redeploy, not assumed.

Migrations applied this deploy: `061_drop_demo_scan_rate_limits.sql` only.

## 2026-09-07

18 commits since the previous deploy, tagged `github-app-deploy-2026-09-07` (commit `ce5ab60`):

- **`get_installation_token` retries once on a transient transport error** (#574): a real
  production failure the same day - `run_push_scan_job` (job_id `5931fc3d`, 6 seconds after PR #563
  merged) hit `httpx.RemoteProtocolError` ("server disconnected without sending a response") against
  GitHub's own API. Diagnosed live via production logs: the identical call from a different job
  succeeded under 2.5 minutes later with no special handling, confirming a one-off transient blip,
  not a code regression. Every caller mints tokens through this one function (queued jobs, webhook
  handlers, dashboard, admin) - a webhook handler has an implicit safety net (GitHub redelivers on a
  non-2xx response), a queued job did not, so the blip permanently dropped that job's scan instead of
  recovering. Now retries once after a 1s delay, scoped to `httpx.TransportError` only.
- **Slack/Teams webhook platform detection now matches the real hostname, not a substring** (#564):
  `_detect_platform` matched `"office.com"` (etc.) anywhere in the full webhook URL - a lookalike
  host (`notoffice.com.evil.example`) or the text appearing in a path/query segment could misroute
  the payload shape. Flagged by GitHub CodeQL as `py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`. Delivery
  itself was never at risk (`_post_to_webhook` only ever sends to the exact address
  `validate_and_pin_https_url` resolved and pinned) - this only affected which JSON shape got sent.
- **AIRview/Docs full-build coverage scales to real repo size** (#562): `MAX_WIKI_FULL_BUILD_CLUSTERS`
  and `MAX_DOCS_FULL_BUILD_FILES` raised 50->200 with chunked per-cluster persistence (a killed/
  timed-out job no longer loses already-paid-for LLM work), AIR plan's LLM spend cap raised to $20 to
  give large real repos room to reach full coverage without excessive 48h catch-up cycles. Designed
  against real griefing/leakage analysis; an atomicity regression in `wiki_write_lock` introduced
  during implementation was caught by independent review and fixed before merge.
- **Flash Review context and spend caps raised** (#563): per-file context cap 80KB->100KB (the old
  cap had caused repeated real file-skips), Flash plan's spend cap $5->$6, sized together with real
  cost math and free-tier provider rate limits, not guessed.
- **GitHub code-scanning triage**: of 29 open alerts, 11 confirmed false positives dismissed with
  documented reasoning (command-injection, clear-text-logging/storage, cookie-injection,
  url-redirection, stack-trace-exposure - each verified against source, not assumed), 1 real finding
  fixed (the Slack/Teams hostname bug above), 15 OpenSSF Scorecard hygiene items left as a lower-
  priority backlog.
- **Dependency bumps regrouped after dependabot split two lockstep pairs across separate PRs**
  (#575): `psycopg`/`psycopg-binary` and `pydantic`/`pydantic-core` each need to move together -
  dependabot's individual PRs for each half were each uninstallable alone. Regenerated both
  lockfiles with `pip-compile --upgrade-package` scoped to exactly those four packages. Also merged
  as separate, real bumps: `rq` 2.11.0->2.12.0, `anyio` 4.14.2->4.15.0, `click` requirement
  <8.5.0-><8.6.0, `coverage` 7.15.4->7.16.0, `cspell` 10.1.1->10.2.2, `cspell-action` 9.0.1->9.1.0.
- **README**: direct GitHub App install link added to the top, above the CLI quickstart (#565) -
  previously only linked to the marketing site, which then linked to the real install URL.
- **Dependabot**: `lodash`/`flask`/`requests` added to the ignore list (#544) - both had already
  bumped a deliberately-pinned-vulnerable benchmark-fixture package past the CVE its ground truth
  exists to test.

No DB migrations in this range. Unlike every prior deploy, this one also rebuilt `jina-embed` and
`demo-scan-worker` alongside the usual five services - both pin `anyio` directly in their own
lockfiles, and the `anyio` bump above touched both.

## 2026-09-06

Largest single deploy batch since 2026-08-27 (second deploy) - 19 commits, tagged
`github-app-deploy-2026-09-06` (commit `cf8d40f`), two workstreams landing together:

- **Schema/ORM-migration pipeline, feeding both review surfaces** (#539, #540, #543, #545-#548,
  #550): a full SQL schema-extraction rewrite (`schema_map.py`, sqlglot-based, multi-dialect) plus a
  new `orm_migrations.py` module modeling Django/Rails/Alembic migrations natively, wired into both
  Flash Review (new `flash_review_schema_context.py`/`flash_review_hunk_scope.py`) and AIRview/Docs
  export (new `airview_scanner_context.py`) so both surfaces can cite real table/column/endpoint
  facts instead of only import-graph structure. #543 also removed the paid-plan entitlement gate
  that had been blocking schema mapping entirely. #550 fixed the migration parser silently dropping
  real operations instead of flagging them as unparseable.
- **Rails model-association clustering fix** (#556) - this session's own finding, from a real
  Discourse benchmark run: `architecture.build_clusters` only sees edges from literal
  import/`require` statements, but Rails models relate via declarative `belongs_to`/`has_many`
  associations that never produce one, so a real 382-file Discourse scan clustered as near-one-file-
  per-cluster. New `model_associations.py` module resolves these (including walking transitive
  `ActiveRecord::Base` inheritance chains) into `extra_edges` for the clustering graph, kept
  separate from real-import edge reporting.
- **ast_pattern batch isolation closed properly** (#552) - the 2026-09-04 fix only caught one
  failure mode (`BrokenProcessPool`/segfault); any other worker exception still discarded every
  earlier batch's real results, and there was no timeout on a hung worker. Both fixed.
- **A real npm unused-dependency bug, same severity class as 2026-09-04's #529** (#553) - scoped
  packages (`@scope/name`) and dotted package names (`normalize.css`, `chart.js`) were both always
  flagged unused due to two separate normalization mismatches.
- **Flash Review `ignored_paths` leak via a second, unfiltered file-listing call** (#554) -
  `fetch_pr_changed_files` (used for full-content fetching, dependency/blast-radius/schema context)
  had no `ignored_paths` filtering, unlike the diff-text path #504 already fixed - an ignored file's
  content could still leak into review context via a different table's schema commentary.
- **Stale embedding-truncation cap** (#555) - `MAX_EMBEDDING_CHARS` was never revisited after the
  local default switched to jina (8192-token context vs. nomic's 2048); large chunks were being
  truncated at a boundary sized for a model no longer in use, discarding real embeddable content.
- **Markdown table-rendering bug in Docs export** (#551) - a literal backtick in a column name broke
  out of its code span in generated tables (backslash-escaping a backtick isn't valid CommonMark
  inside a code span). Found by Flash Review's own review of the PR that introduced the bug; fixed
  with a properly variable-length fence.
- **`aletheore mcp-install` gained Antigravity and Claude Desktop as targets** (#557) - found via an
  audit of the MCP layer's cross-client compatibility. Antigravity's config is schema-identical to
  Cursor's, just a different path. Claude Desktop is architecturally different from every other
  target - a single global config file shared across every project on the machine, not scoped per
  repo - so entries there are keyed `aletheore-<repo-name>` rather than the plain `aletheore` every
  other target uses, so installing for a second repo doesn't silently overwrite the first repo's
  entry in the one shared file.

No DB migrations in this range. All five app-relevant services (`app-server`, `scan-worker`,
`scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, `scheduler`) rebuilt and re-verified live post-deploy - see
`docs/operations/DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md`'s Current Server Snapshot for the full verification.

## 2026-08-28

- **`managed_audit` switched off Luna/deepseek-v4-pro onto deepseek-v4-flash** (#451) - measured
  directly across three full audit runs against this repo, same evidence and manual each time: Luna
  ($0.15/run) missed a real circular import, deepseek-v4-pro ($1.15/run) caught it but at 3x the
  per-token rate for no extra work done, deepseek-v4-flash ($0.40/run) caught the same finding at a
  fraction of pro's cost. Flash is the only one of the three that's both accurate and cheap for this
  task. Also fixed a real crash this exposed: every Luna-routed `managed_audit` run had been
  crashing on its first LLM call (`OpenAICompatibleAdapter.invoke()` missing `extra_body`, see the
  root `CHANGELOG.md`'s 0.9.8 entry) - `audit_reports` had been empty across every installation ever
  as a result, which is how this got found in the first place.
- **Paddle webhook plan-change writes made atomic** (#449, audit finding 11) - three separate DB
  writes on a plan change (installation row, subscription record, billing history) previously ran as
  independent statements; a crash mid-sequence could leave billing state half-written. Now wrapped
  in a single transaction.
- **Repo-existence oracle closed** (#450, audit finding 12) - an admin/dashboard route that 404'd
  for "you don't have access" but returned a different status for "this repo doesn't exist at all"
  let anyone probe which private repos exist on an installation they have no access to, just from
  the response shape. Both cases now return the identical 404.
- **Scanner-side fixes** (Java/C# pre-pass memory bound, 8 import-resolution correctness bugs,
  endpoint cache cross-file invalidation) shipped via the `src/aletheore` rebuild that comes bundled
  with every scan-worker image - see the root [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)'s 0.9.8 entry for
  the full detail on each.

## 2026-08-27

- **Soft-hide a repo removed from the installation, and stop processing it** (#437) -
  `handle_installation_event` had no branch at all for `installation_repositories`/`removed`
  (deselecting one repo from the GitHub App's repo list without uninstalling the whole app): the
  repo's dashboard entry, scan history, and every scheduled/webhook-triggered work path stayed
  live indefinitely, with no purge path anywhere in the codebase. Found by a second Claude session
  (`veridion-68`) during the ongoing `jobs.py`-adjacent hardening sweep; flagged as a design
  decision (hard-purge vs. soft-hide) rather than patched unilaterally, since it's new
  data-deletion logic on a webhook path with production customer data at stake. Arihant's call:
  soft-hide - reversible if the repo is reselected later, but must actually stop being processed
  (not just disappear from the dashboard), since a hidden-but-still-scanning repo keeps burning
  real LLM spend and billed capacity for a repo the customer explicitly walked away from. New
  `hidden_repos` table (migration 057); gates the dashboard repo list, the PR/push/`/aletheore
  audit` webhook paths, and all three scheduled sweeps that generate new per-repo work
  (health-check, docs catch-up, wiki catch-up); reversed by `installation_repositories/added`.
- **Reduced Aletheore AIR's included seats from 5 to 3, repriced the extra-seat add-on from
  $4.99 to $6.99/month** (#435) - a real pricing change, not a bug fix: 5 seats was more value
  than the $29.99/mo base price should bundle. `db.py`'s `INCLUDED_SEATS["air"]` dropped to 3;
  `paddle_pricing.py`'s `EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_ID` points at a new $6.99 Paddle price (the old $4.99
  price was archived, not mutated, after confirming zero live subscribers on it). A second Claude
  session (`veridion-68`) reviewed the branch for other places the price change could hit and
  found one the PR's own diff had missed: `llm_cost.py`'s `EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_USD` - a separate
  constant read directly by the dashboard's "Buy extra seat" button and by the seat-cap-reached
  error message - was still 4.99, which would have shown customers the wrong price at the exact
  moment they were about to be charged the new one. Fixed same-day before merge.
- **Three real bugs found and fixed in `scan_worker/jobs.py`** (the repo's own
  worst code-health hotspot: 1.65/10 defect risk, 38 prior bug-fixes in 6
  months), from a proactive dual-pass audit (this session plus a second
  independent Claude session, `veridion-68`, auditing the same file with
  fresh eyes):
  - **#405** — when every free-tier LLM provider failed mid-review,
    `_run_flash_review` correctly skipped billing but still posted "No
    issues found in this diff." to the PR and advanced `last_reviewed_sha`
    — falsely telling the user their PR was reviewed clean, and
    permanently skipping the diff range that actually failed to review.
  - **#406** — `run_pr_scan_job` was calling `_sync_persistent_git_graph`
    against a PR's own head checkout, which always writes under the fixed
    `GRAPH_BRANCH="default"` key — permanently folding unmerged, possibly-
    rejected PR commits into the persisted default-branch git graph
    (ownership/churn/cadence) the dashboard and future incremental syncs
    read from.
  - **#407** — the direct sibling of #406, found immediately after by
    re-auditing code adjacent to the fix: `_sync_code_graph` (its own
    docstring calls itself "the counterpart to `_sync_persistent_git_graph`
    ... for the code model rather than git history") had the exact same
    unconditional-`GRAPH_BRANCH`-write bug, corrupting the durable
    `code_graph_files/symbols/dependency_edges/endpoints` tables that back
    several MCP tools.
  - Deployed to every service that actually executes `scan_worker/jobs.py`:
    `scan-worker`, `scan-worker-2`, `health-worker`, and `scheduler` — all
    four share `Dockerfile.scan-worker` but compose tags them as separate
    images, so each needed its own explicit rebuild (same gotcha as the
    prior secrets-fix deploy). `app-server` also bundles a copy of
    `scan_worker/` but only ever references these job names as string
    literals for RQ enqueue, never imports/executes them directly, so it
    needed no rebuild for this fix. Verified live: the new bail-out and
    call-site-removal comments are present in the deployed
    `scan-worker` container's `jobs.py`, and all four containers came up
    healthy.

## 2026-08-26-2

- **Deployed the secret-scanner false-positive fixes** (#402) to every
  image bundling `src/aletheore`: `app-server`, `scan-worker`,
  `scan-worker-2`, and `demo-sandbox` (the build-only image ephemeral demo
  scans run from - easy to miss since it has no long-running container of
  its own to recreate; rebuilt explicitly and verified against a one-off
  `docker run`). `scan-worker-2` needed its own explicit rebuild too -
  despite sharing `Dockerfile.scan-worker` with `scan-worker`, compose
  tags it as a separately-named image, so rebuilding `scan-worker` alone
  left it on the old image until force-recreated against its own fresh
  build. `demo-scan-worker` and `demo-sandbox-runner` don't bundle
  `aletheore` at all (the former only coordinates queued jobs, the latter
  only shells out to `docker run --runtime=runsc` against the
  `demo-sandbox` image) and needed no change. Verified live on all four:
  `KNOWN_VENDOR_EXAMPLE_VALUES` present in each container's
  `secrets.py`/installed package.

## 2026-08-26

- **Dependency bumps deployed to `app-server` and `jina-embed`**: uvicorn
  0.52.3 → 0.52.4, llama-cpp-python 0.3.34 → 0.3.35 (both dependabot-driven,
  no code changes). Verified live: `pip show` on both containers matches the
  new pinned versions, both healthchecks pass post-recreate.

## 2026-08-25-2

- **Redesigned the settings page's three alert-channel blocks** (Slack/Teams, email, Pushover)
  into one consolidated "Alert channels" card with labeled sub-sections instead of three separate
  bordered blocks repeating near-identical copy - also rebalanced the two-column layout (previously
  5 blocks in one column vs. 3 in the other). Flash Review caught a real CSS bug in the same PR:
  `.alert-channel:first-of-type` matches by tag name, not class, so it never matched anything;
  replaced with an adjacent-sibling selector (#397).

## 2026-08-25

- **Endpoint-monitoring alerts gained two new delivery channels: email and Pushover,**
  alongside the existing Slack/Teams webhook - configure any combination
  (`installations.alert_email`, `installations.pushover_user_key`). Pushover down-alerts use
  emergency priority (repeats and requires acknowledgement until dismissed); every other alert
  stays at normal priority. `PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN` is a new, optional server-wide secret (#389,
  #390).
- **Aletheore's own Flash Review caught a real high-severity ReDoS in the alert-email format
  check** (`^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$`, quadratic blowup on a crafted string) on #389's own CI
  run - replaced with plain string checks, no backtracking possible. Its own regression test
  initially didn't reproduce the bug either (payload accidentally matched the old regex instead of
  triggering it) - fixed in a follow-up (#392, #393). Flash Review also caught a second real
  issue: `health_alert_email` interpolated repository-controlled evidence text (commit subjects,
  symbol names) into HTML with no escaping - same bug class the wiki renderer already guards
  against, fixed the same way (escape first, then promote markdown) (#393).
- **`run_initial_scan_job` crashed on a repo with no commits yet** - GitHub's commits endpoint
  returns 409 for a genuinely empty repo, not an error, but the fetch called `raise_for_status()`
  unconditionally, firing a spurious ops alert for what was never a failure (#387).
- **A Paddle subscription event whose `installation_token` failed to unsign silently no-op'd**
  (200 to Paddle, no retry, nothing else surfaced it) - now fires an ops alert instead (#384).
- **The backup-freshness ops alert false-positived on the daily cron/dump-duration race** - the
  check's own polling loop isn't wall-clock-anchored to the backup cron, so a sample could land in
  the few-second gap after yesterday's dump crosses the staleness threshold but before today's
  lands. Padded the threshold by 10 minutes to absorb the jitter (#383).

## 2026-08-24

- **Live-wiki/docs incremental update jobs could reload evidence from a different, newer scan.**
  Found by our own Flash Review, dogfooded on #364 itself (which decoupled these jobs from the
  scan job's timeout the day before): they reloaded evidence via `get_latest_evidence` -
  "whatever's newest right now" - rather than the exact row the enqueuing scan persisted. A second
  scan for the same repo persisting first would make the job combine that newer evidence with the
  older scan's `changed_files`/`head_sha`, applying an incremental update against a mismatched
  revision. Fixed by threading the specific `repo_history` row id through the queue and reloading
  by that exact id (`get_evidence_by_id`) instead (#369).
- **5 remaining findings from the second-pass audit, all real, all fixed with tests (#19, #22,
  #24, #25, #26):** a local `router = APIRouter(...)` in an unrelated FastAPI factory function
  could silently overwrite the real module-level router's prefix (scope-blind AST walk, no code
  fix needed here - this one lives in the `aletheore` CLI package, not this backend); `audit`'s
  `--no-map-schema` flag was parsed but never forwarded, so it was completely inert (also CLI
  package); health-check-target and API-token creation were check-then-act under concurrent
  requests, unlike the seat-limit fix already in this same file - fixed with the same
  advisory-lock-wrapped CTE pattern; `generate_token` discarded the real token id and re-derived
  it via a racy re-query, folded into the same fix; `_fetch_whoami`'s JSON parsing sat outside its
  own try/except (CLI package). Backend-relevant pieces (the concurrency fixes) deployed here;
  the three CLI-only fixes ship with the next `aletheore` PyPI release, not this deploy.

## 2026-08-23

- **AIRview/Docs incremental updates were sharing the PR/push scan job's 300s `job_timeout`,**
  and RQ's watchdog killed the whole scan job mid-flight on large repos once the writing stage
  ran long - "Work-horse terminated unexpectedly" in the `scans` queue. Decoupled both updates
  into their own separately-timed jobs (`run_live_wiki_incremental_update_job` /
  `run_live_docs_incremental_update_job`, 600s each), enqueued instead of called inline, reloading
  evidence from the DB rather than passing it through the queue (#364).
- **The ops/error alert cooldown was 15 minutes, not the agreed 6 hours.** Confirmed against the
  live inbox: `ops_monitor.failed_jobs.scans` re-alerted roughly every 15-30 minutes throughout
  2026-08-22 while the timeout bug above kept the `scans` queue's failed-jobs count continuously
  above threshold. Both `OPS_ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` and `error_alerts._ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`
  were still at the original 900s from #286; bumped both to 6 hours so a persisting issue gets one
  alert and periodic reminders, not one every cycle (#365). Cleared 5 stale entries from the
  `scans` `FailedJobRegistry` post-deploy (2 an orphan-container artifact from the first 08-22
  deploy, already explained in that day's changelog entry; 3 the timeout bug above) so the new
  cooldown didn't start by re-alerting on already-resolved history.

## 2026-08-22 (second deploy)

- **Three crash/broken-feature bugs from the second-pass audit, all live in production:**
  one invalid-UTF-8 byte anywhere in a scanned repo aborted the *entire* scan
  (39 unguarded `.decode()` calls in the scanner, all now `errors="ignore"`); AIRview's
  Q&A path crashed with a `TypeError` on its own best-case (dual-retriever) match, because
  RRF fusion silently dropped the vector distance score on any chunk found by both
  retrievers; AIRview's fallback for non-scanned files (docs, configs, Dockerfiles) called
  a function name that was never imported (`NameError`, silently caught) and 404'd on every
  request (#360).
- **Nothing alerted when a free-tier provider key went missing.** The gap found and fixed
  earlier today (see the "config, not a code deploy" entry below) had no monitoring - a new
  ops-monitor check now alerts per-provider (Groq/Gemini/OpenAI-FreeTier/OpenRouter) within
  minutes instead of staying silent for weeks (#357).

## 2026-08-22

24 commits accumulated since the 8/21 deploy tag and shipped together in this one:

- **AIRview writing surface now always uses deepseek-v4-flash, never GPT-5.6 Luna**, regardless of
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` availability - a benchmark re-run (5 language corpora, blind judge) found
  DeepSeek beats Luna specifically for this comprehension-writing surface, the opposite of what
  holds for PR review and coding benchmarks elsewhere, so the switch is scoped narrowly to AIRview
  via a new `writing_adapter_for_airview` (#352).
- **Architecture clustering no longer counts test files as subsystems.** Reproduced on
  AutoMapper/AutoMapper: 82% of the dependency graph was test files, fragmenting what should have
  been a handful of subsystems into 119 near-singleton clusters. Fixed by excluding test paths
  before clustering, the same filter already used for retrieval (#353).
- Spend-cap check-and-record was two separate lock acquisitions for both fix-suggestion and
  AIRview live-wiki spend budgets - a race that could let concurrent calls both pass the cap
  check before either recorded usage. Fixed via atomic reservation (#331, #332).
- AIRview banner still claimed incremental updates use a fast model after that had changed (#350).
- Healthcheck sweep exited 0 and printed no summary even when every endpoint was unreachable
  (#349); CI never actually booted the app-server/scan-worker images before this - the same class
  of gap that caused the #246 crash-loop incident could have shipped silently again (#342).
  Real end-to-end integration test added for the health-check sweep (#351).
- Audit's sponsor panel claimed nothing left the machine after evidence was actually sent out
  (#348).
- Local search index now detects an embedder swap even when the new embedder happens to produce
  the same dimensionality (#347); three other retrieval-quality regressions in `search_index.py`
  fixed (#340); embedding-cache rows now carry the embedder identity that produced them, closing
  the gap the above fix needed (#343, migration `049_purge_cache_for_embedder_switch.sql`).
- Flash review similarity cache retained raw PR diffs indefinitely instead of expiring them
  (#344).
- Three CLI UX gaps found while auditing for more issues like the update-notice one (#346); bare
  CLI invocation now surfaces an available update (#345); `mcp-install` prints a copyable
  `claude mcp add` command for Claude Code (#341).
- FastAPI router mounted implicitly alongside a prefixed mount lost its own unprefixed endpoint
  (#339); router-mount prefixes could cross-contaminate between files (#333).
- Schema-mapper silently corrupted on ordinary SQL comments (#338).
- Secret scanner missed dotted-attribute credential assignments (#334).
- Java/C# pre-parsed trees stayed pinned in memory for the whole scan instead of being released
  (#337).
- Module-overview chunk boundary used the wrong "first" symbol (#336).
- Unpinned marker-qualified PEP 508 dependency was silently dropped (#335).
- Benchmark numbers on the public site updated to the current, re-verified figures: 40.5ms mean
  retrieval latency (was 125ms) vs RepoWise's 52.5ms, and 2.00 vs 1.77 average comprehension score
  across 5 language corpora (#354).

## 2026-08-22 (config, not a code deploy)

- **Free-tier Flash Review provider keys added to production.** `writing_adapter_chain_for_free_tier`
  (the Groq -> Gemini -> OpenAI-FreeTier -> OpenRouter fallback chain, hardened across #304/#314/
  #316/#319/#344) has been fully implemented and deployed for weeks, but production's `.env` never
  actually had `GROQ_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_FREE_TIER_API_KEY`/`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set -
  every provider silently skipped, the chain built empty, and every free-tier Flash Review no-op'd
  with only a log warning (`jobs.py`'s `if not free_tier_chain: ... return False`), no user-facing
  error. Found while re-verifying this session's other changes were actually live. Keys were present
  locally in `github-app/.env` but had never been synced to the server - copied over (values never
  passed through any tool output or log), `scan-worker` (both replicas) and `health-worker`
  restarted, confirmed live via `has_api_key()` boolean checks (never the raw values) returning
  `True` for all four providers. This is a config change, not a code deploy - no new commit or
  `github-app-deploy-*` tag for it, same as the Paddle webhook destination note below.

- **AIRview and Docs generation cut down to a fraction of their prior LLM call volume.**
  Subsystem and file-page writing for AIRview now batch 5 items per call instead of one, with
  per-item retry only on the items that fail (batch size chosen conservatively - a prior
  experiment merging more content into single prompts silently dropped subsystem coverage from
  83 files to 14 on Flask). Docs' incremental-update path had zero per-call spend gating (a large
  push had no dollar ceiling at all); it now uses the same `_IncrementalSpendBudget` gate the
  full-build path already had, and its two-call-per-module generate/polish pass merged into one.
  Estimated worst case for a full AIRview build: ~$8.40 -> ~$1-2; a large Docs push: uncapped ->
  hard-capped by the shared monthly spend budget.
- **Docs no longer re-describes every symbol in a file on every push that touches it.** A new
  `content_hash` column on `docs_symbols` lets a symbol be skipped if its source snippet is
  unchanged since it was last described - previously, touching one function in a 20-function file
  re-sent all 20 to the LLM, every push, with no memory of prior generations.
- **Health-fix-suggestion no longer re-fires on a flapping endpoint.** A 30-minute cooldown
  (`was_recently_down`) means one down/up/down incident produces one LLM-generated suggestion, not
  a fresh one on every flip - matching how Sentry groups repeat issues rather than re-alerting on
  each occurrence.
- **AIR's PR review cap raised from 300 to 500/month; free tier held at 150.** This is a
  usage-promise ceiling, not a cost-protection measure - the separate dollar-based spend cap is
  unaffected and remains the real defense against a pathological per-review cost.
- **Flash Review now defaults to "compact" evidence (diff + Aletheore's own context, no raw
  file-content dump) instead of including full file contents in the prompt.** A 3-run real
  Luna-generates/DeepSeek-verifies benchmark (see `aletheore-benchmarks/pr_review/README.md`,
  Experiment 4) found compact held 96.7-97.7% independently-verified accept rate across every run
  while full-context swung 85.7-100% and never once won, using a fraction of the prompt tokens.
  Citation verification still uses the real fetched file content; only the prompt-facing blob is
  dropped.
- **Removed the CLI's anonymous usage-ping endpoint (`/v1/telemetry`) from the backend.** It was
  the single most exposed, unauthenticated write path in the service. See the root
  [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)'s 0.8.13 entry for the CLI-side half of this change.

## 2026-08-18

- **Fixed a diff-parser collision that silently dropped real findings.** `_diff_valid_lines`
  recovers per-file boundaries from a `--- {filename} ---` marker `fetch_pr_diff` inserts into the
  flattened diff text. A deleted line whose content is `-- x ---` (any SQL/Lua/Haskell comment, or
  a `--- section ---` divider in any language) arrives in that text as `--- x ---` after the diff's
  own `-` prefix — indistinguishable from a real marker. The real change following it got
  attributed to a phantom file and dropped from the valid-line set, surfacing as "No issues found
  in this diff." Fixed by requiring a marker to sit at an actual file boundary (start of text, or
  immediately after a blank line — the only place a real one is ever placed).
- **Scanner walked the repo tree 19 times per scan, six of them unpruned.** Six detectors (migration
  dirs, docker-compose, kubernetes manifests, terraform files, helm charts, declared env vars) each
  called `repo_path.rglob(...)` independently and filtered `IGNORED_DIRS` out afterward — walking
  into `node_modules`/`.git`/`vendor` on every scan and discarding what they found. Replaced with
  one shared pruned `os.walk`; verified byte-identical output before and after, ~7.75x faster on
  this repo.
- **Ops-monitor alerts re-fired on every ~3-minute check with no cooldown.** A month-old,
  since-fixed health-check-sweep bug (`c34aa6c`) had left 186 failed jobs sitting in the "scans"
  queue's `FailedJobRegistry` that nothing ever cleared — the alert had been silently re-firing on
  that same stale condition ever since, 918 emails accumulated in Spam before this was caught.
  Fixed with a Redis cooldown centralized in `_send_ops_alert` itself, so every ops-alert source
  gets it automatically. Cleared the 349 stale failed jobs on production after verifying each
  failure category first — some already fixed by this same deploy, the rest resolved
  historical/external incidents (GitHub's own API outage, not a code bug).
- **Raised Flash Review's context-depth caps for the paid tier.** Doubled eight constants governing
  how much of a PR's changed-file content, referenced definitions, and blast-radius symbols get
  analyzed — real headroom was there and unused (current worst case ~56,000 tokens against Luna's
  1,050,000-token window, pricing flat to 272,000). One real corpus case
  (`swebench-django-14434`) had its changed file entirely excluded from review under the old
  per-file byte cap; it's included now.

## 2026-08-17

- **`app-server`'s own httpx client to `jina-embed` raised from a 60.0s timeout to 120.0s.**
  It was the actual binding constraint underneath the whole hosted-embedding path: the CLI's own
  client to `app-server` (`src/aletheore/search_index.py`) has used a 120.0s timeout all along, but
  `app-server` was cutting itself off against `jina-embed` at half that budget. Raised alongside real
  per-token timing evidence measured directly against `jina-embed` post-multi-instance (#267, 2
  instances): 88,859 tokens took 124.70s, close to the new ceiling rather than an untested
  extrapolation past it.
- **`/v1/embeddings` now caps concurrent hosted-embed requests, not just requests per hour.**
  The existing rate limiter throttled request *count per window*, which did nothing about several
  requests landing on `jina-embed` at the same moment - it runs `JINA_EMBED_INSTANCES=2`, each
  single-threaded, so a third concurrent request just queues behind a lock until one frees up,
  inside whatever's left of the 120s timeout above. A Redis sorted-set semaphore now admits at
  most `MAX_CONCURRENT_HOSTED_EMBED_REQUESTS` (default 2, matched to `JINA_EMBED_INSTANCES`) at
  once, refusing the rest with 429 and a short `Retry-After` (3s, not the rate limiter's hour) -
  self-healing against a crashed holder via a TTL slightly above the 120s request timeout, so a
  process that dies mid-request leaks its slot for at most that long, never permanently. The CLI's
  `embed_texts_hosted` now retries on 429 (bounded, capped sleep) before falling back to local
  embeddings or failing an in-progress index build, so the common case - a momentary capacity blip
  under concurrent load - costs a short wait instead of degrading the result.

## 2026-08-16

- **jina-embed now runs llama.cpp against a Q8_0 GGUF quantization of jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code,
  replacing the raw PyTorch/HuggingFace `transformers` backend.** Earlier the same day, two production
  incidents against that backend (a request that never finished within the 60s timeout, then an
  OOM kill under a mem_limit already raised to accommodate it) traced back to comparing the wrong
  things: nomic-embed-text, which this service replaced, was served by Ollama's llama.cpp engine -
  quantized weights, hand-tuned CPU kernels - while jina-embed ran unquantized in eager-mode PyTorch.
  Measured directly on this host against a real 133k-char, 38-chunk flask source sample: the old
  backend hadn't finished the first fifth of the batch after 164s before OOM-killing; llama.cpp
  finished the same batch in 24.55s (~5,400 chars/s) at a 375MB peak, against the old backend's
  2.44GB+. Quantization cost was checked directly too - 0.9997 cosine similarity against the
  full-precision embedding on the same input. `jina-embed`'s `mem_limit` comes back down from the
  emergency-raised 6000m to 2000m on this evidence.
- **`jina-embed` runs 2 independent model instances (`JINA_EMBED_INSTANCES=2`) instead of 1 instance
  parallelizing across 2 threads.** Same total CPU budget, differently spent: a single instance
  splitting one embedding call across threads pays real synchronization overhead inside llama.cpp's
  matmul kernels, while N single-threaded instances processing N requests concurrently pay none of
  that - pure task parallelism. Measured locally (4 concurrent streams of real `apache/thrift` source,
  `--cpus=2` both configurations): 2x1 threads finished in 223.27s against 1x2's 238.83s, ~6.5% faster
  on identical CPU. More importantly, it reduces queueing delay under concurrent load specifically -
  every caller (two `scan-worker` replicas, `demo-scan-worker`, hosted index builds) previously queued
  behind one locked instance even when their requests were otherwise fully independent, which
  contributed to a real `ReadTimeout` on a thrift-scale request (see the char-cap entry below).
  Memory checked under real concurrent load, not assumed: peaked at 620MiB, comfortably inside the
  existing 2000m limit.
- **`HOSTED_EMBED_MAX_CHARS` lowered from 130,000 to 60,000.** 130,000 was reasoned from a single
  isolated request measurement (24.55s, zero concurrent load) and caused a real failure: a thrift
  index build hit `ReadTimeout` at exactly 60.1s and lost 22 minutes of progress, because real latency
  under concurrent load is compute time plus queueing delay, not compute time alone. 60,000 leaves
  ~37s of margin against the 60s timeout at the measured ~2,630 chars/s real-world throughput, still
  3x the original 20,000 baseline. Should be revisited once the multi-instance change above has real
  concurrent-load evidence behind it, rather than another single-request extrapolation.

## 2026-08-12

- AIRview depth: file-level reference pages. Each important file now gets a sectioned page
  (Overview / Why it exists / How it works / Key symbols / Gotchas) hanging off the existing
  `files` JSON column, so there is no migration and no new table. The dashboard renders it as a
  collapsed "Reference" disclosure per file. Measured against RepoWise's wiki with a blind,
  order-swapped judge: the gap closed from 1.33 to roughly 0.2, at about one seventh their token
  cost. Harness and raw results at
  [Aletheore/aletheore-benchmarks](https://github.com/Aletheore/aletheore-benchmarks).
- Subsystem prose may now cite any file in the repository, not only files inside its own cluster.
  `verify_citations` already validated repo-wide, so the restriction added no safety while
  blocking exactly the cross-cutting explanations (request flow, lifecycle) that span subsystems.
- **The wiki's file list no longer depends on the model finishing its output.** It was whatever
  the model echoed back, so a large enough prompt silently shrank it — on Flask, records went from
  83 files to 14, stranding 23 already-generated file pages, since a page can only attach to a
  file entry that exists. The list is now built from the scan for every file in the brief and the
  model's prose merged onto it. Invented files are still dropped. This would have hit any large
  repository.
- File pages salvage instead of discarding. One unverifiable citation used to throw away a whole
  page of otherwise-verified prose; the offending lines are now removed and the remainder
  re-verified, dropping the page only if less than 60% survives. Subsystems already degraded this
  way; file pages now match. 28 of 31 pages kept on Flask.
- Clusters made entirely of tests, examples or docs no longer get a subsystem or an LLM call.
  Measured across eight repositories, 334 subsystem clusters became 87 — 74% fewer calls. serde
  was the extreme case at 160 -> 10. Mixed clusters are kept, and a repo that is all tests keeps
  everything rather than producing an empty wiki.
- The AIRview cache key now carries a prompt version. It depended only on the scan, so editing any
  writing prompt would have silently served pages written by the previous prompt forever.
- Dashboard markdown for generated pages escapes before promoting any tag, so repository content
  reaching the browser through a model's output cannot become live HTML.

## 2026-08-10

- Affiliate program: manually-onboarded creators get a Paddle discount code (10% off first month)
  that doubles as the attribution key. `subscription.created` now records a referral on free ->
  paid signup when the code matches a known affiliate; `transaction.completed` (previously
  unhandled) records 15% recurring commission per billing cycle. New internal admin routes
  (`/admin/affiliates`) behind a dedicated `AFFILIATE_ADMIN_TOKEN` for onboarding, reporting, and
  marking commissions paid. Payouts stay manual and off-platform.
- Self-serve data export (JSON snapshot of repos, findings, members, token labels, health
  targets), an admin action audit log covering member/token/webhook/setting changes, and an
  email-OTP requirement on top of the existing typed confirmation for delete-all-data — closing a
  stolen-session-cookie gap the typed confirmation alone didn't cover.
- Suppressed 45 secrets-scanner findings on our own repo that were all synthetic values in test
  fixtures or old planning docs — dogfooding noise, not real secrets.
- Self-serve data deletion extended to free-plan installations (previously paid-plan only), AIR
  evidence schema validation, webhook replay/duplicate protection (GitHub + Paddle), an MCP
  consent boundary gating tools that transmit repo evidence externally, and body-size/rate-limit
  controls on the two unauthenticated ingestion endpoints (`/v1/telemetry`, `/v1/runtime-events`).

## 2026-08-09

- Reliability: heartbeat-based hang detection with auto-restart, Docker healthchecks + an autoheal
  watchdog, and a staleness alert on the health-check sweep itself.
- Extra seat price bump to $4.99/mo with its LLM cap allowance decoupled to $3.00, fixing a
  zero-margin gap.
- Dismiss/mute findings on the hosted dashboard (per-repo, identity-keyed, survives re-scans).
- `.aletheore.json` repo config: ignored paths, disabled checks, severity threshold — the
  mechanism later used (2026-08-10) to clean up our own dogfooding noise.
- PR review and AIRview writing surfaces routed onto GPT-5.6 Luna; AIRview full-build frequency
  capped.
- Public security/trust page; rate limiting on `/auth/login` and `/auth/callback`; alerting on
  unhandled exceptions in our own backend.
- Self-serve Paddle billing portal link and LLM-spend/Flash-review usage surfaced in the
  dashboard.
- Hosted AI-generated Docs: single downloadable markdown export, optional commit of the reference
  into the customer's own repo, dashboard polish.
- Transactional email (welcome, payment-failed, subscription-canceled, branded templates) and a
  weekly usage digest, both via Resend; fixed a send timing out on httpx's 5s default.
- Flash Review: fixed a too-tight `job_timeout` silently killing most reviews; stopped
  double-fetching file content on every review.

## 2026-08-08

- Closed a redirect-following SSRF-adjacent gap and a queue-contention issue in health
  monitoring.
- Public status page shipped; two live monitoring bugs found in the process, fixed.
- Blocking Paddle API calls and `get_settings()` re-reads taken off the request hot path.
- Two real bugs found dogfooding our own scanner: worktree-corrupted dead-code detection, a Flash
  Review escaping false positive.

## 2026-08-07

- Hosted AI-enhanced Docs: per-symbol AI descriptions, nesting fix, 48h catch-up sweep for
  installations that missed a build window.
- Blocking GitHub API calls taken off the single event loop.
- Dashboard: stopped leaking raw Paddle error strings to users, explained what API tokens are for,
  fixed a no-op on an empty label.
