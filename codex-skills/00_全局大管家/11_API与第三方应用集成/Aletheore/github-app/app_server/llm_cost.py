# flash's real spend cap is a deliberately looser fraction of its price

# 2026-09-07 alongside github_api.MAX_CONTEXT_FILE_BYTES's 80KB->100KB
# raise, which this headroom is specifically sized against). $5's own real
# worst-case figure: ~$4.34 for 1000 reviews of solo Luna generation (no
# dual-agent verification, compact + trimmed diff), i.e. ~$3.47 for the
# 800-review/month cap this tier actually enforces, under the OLD 80KB
# per-file context cap. Scaling that real figure by the same ratio the
# 80KB->100KB raise applies to context size (1.25x, not a full 2x -
# extrapolated from the 40KB->80KB raise's own measured ~2x cost impact,
# not a fresh re-benchmark) gives an estimated ~$4.34/month under the new
# 100KB cap. $6 leaves ~38% headroom over that estimate ((6.00-4.34)/4.34) -
# close to the original 44% design margin the $5 cap had at 80KB, not the
# thin ~15% a full 2x raise to 120KB would have left (120KB's own estimate:
# $3.47 x 1.5 = ~$5.21/month, (6.00-5.21)/5.21 = ~15%) - both figures use
# the same (cap-cost)/cost formula the original 44% used, not (cap-cost)/cap
# (an earlier version of this comment mixed the two, understating this
# margin as ~28% and the rejected alternative's as ~13% - found via
# independent audit). Deliberate: the context-cap raise was picked at
# 1.25x specifically to keep this margin close to its original size rather
# than eroding it for a bigger win. This was checked against an 800-review/
# month workload; that count is no longer enforced (the credit balance is
# the only paid-plan limit, see PLAN_BASE_CREDIT_USD).
# air's real spend cap is a deliberately looser fraction of its price than
# the shared 50% default below, raised from the derived $14.995 to a flat
# $20 - real production repos vary far more in size than the fixed-cost
# review workload flash's own override above is tuned against, and
# MAX_WIKI_FULL_BUILD_CLUSTERS/MAX_DOCS_FULL_BUILD_FILES now scale their
# per-sweep batch to a repo's real cluster/module count (up to a ceiling),
# not a flat number - a large real repo (a Discourse-scale monorepo
# measured directly: 857 real clusters, ~$0.37 per 50-cluster batch, so
# full first-build coverage capped at the new 200-cluster ceiling costs
# real single-digit dollars, not fractions of a cent) needs real headroom
# to make meaningful progress per catch-up cycle instead of the old cap
# forcing an artificially small per-sweep batch just to stay under it.
