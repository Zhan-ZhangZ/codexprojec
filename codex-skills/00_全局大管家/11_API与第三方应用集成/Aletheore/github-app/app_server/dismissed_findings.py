# Unlike a secret (path+pattern+match_preview) or a vulnerability
# (ecosystem+package+advisory_id), a Flash Review finding has no natural
# unique id - "issue" is free-text a model wrote, and the same underlying
# bug can come back reworded (different phrasing, different word order)
# across two independent generations of the same diff. Hashing the raw
# text would treat any rewording as a brand-new finding, silently
# resurrecting something a user already dismissed. Hashing file+line alone
# would go too far the other way: two genuinely different bugs that happen
# to land on the same line across two unrelated pushes (rare, but not
# impossible - a fixed bug's line later hosting an unrelated new one) would
# collapse into one identity.
#
# The middle ground here: normalize the issue text (lowercase, strip
# punctuation, drop a short stopword list, collapse to a set of the
# remaining significant words) and hash that set rather than the raw
# string. A set - not a sequence - so word-order changes ("the null check
# was removed" vs "removed the null check") don't change the key, while
# genuinely different wording (different nouns/verbs describing a
# different problem) does. This is a considered design choice, not a
# verified one: there is no real corpus of "same bug, reworded across two
# independent re-reviews of the same diff" available to test it against,
# so its resilience to real model rewording is untested past the
# synthetic cases in test_dismissed_findings.py. Line is still exact-match
# (consistent with how secret/vulnerability identity already works, no
# fuzzy tolerance there either) - a finding that shifts by even one line
# because of an unrelated edit above it gets a fresh identity, a known,
# accepted limitation shared with the other two finding types.

def finding_identity_key(finding_type: str, finding: dict) -> str:
    """Canonical identity string for a finding, used both to store a
    dismissal and to check whether a fresh finding matches one already
    dismissed. Uses the same field tuples history.py already uses for
    new/resolved diffing: (path, pattern, match_preview) for secrets,
    (ecosystem, package, advisory_id) for vulnerabilities. \x1f (unit
    separator) joins fields - not a character any of these fields would
    plausibly contain.

    For secrets, match_preview embeds this server's only knowledge of "which
    credential" - the raw value never leaves the scan (see
    src/aletheore/secrets.py's _redact), so if that preview's format ever
    changes again, a dismissal keyed on the old format becomes permanently
    unmatchable here, unlike the CLI's own accepted_secrets baseline, which
    can recompute a legacy-format preview from the value it still has on
    hand. There's no dual-check to add on this side - see migration 045 for
    the cleanup this fired once already, and repeat that pattern (a
    migration that purges now-unreachable rows, not a data migration) if the
    preview format changes again.

    flash_review_llm and flash_review_semantic (Flash Review's model-
    generated and deterministic findings respectively - kept as two
    distinct types rather than one, so dismissal-rate comparisons between
    them stay possible) use file+line+_issue_fingerprint(issue) - see that
    function's docstring for why a fingerprint rather than the raw text.

    static_analysis (SonarQube/Semgrep/Bearer/gosec/Bandit/Joern/Trivy/PMD, normalized
    into security.static_analysis - see src/aletheore/static_analysis/)
    uses path+position+tool+rule_id, where position is the finding's
    content_fingerprint when one exists (a hash of the source lines around
    it, computed at scan time - see static_analysis/__init__.py's
    _add_content_fingerprints) or its line number otherwise. A deterministic
    scanner's rule_id is stable across re-runs of the same code, so this
    doesn't need _issue_fingerprint's reworded-text tolerance - but the line
    number alone is not: an unrelated edit elsewhere in the file shifts it
    without changing the finding, which used to permanently orphan a
    dismissal the moment that happened (see history.py's own identical
    problem on the diffing side, and
    docs/audits/2026-10-01-static-analysis-dismissal-and-line-shift.md).
    Falling back to line when no fingerprint exists keeps every dismissal
    recorded before this field existed matching exactly as before - same
    straddling-upgrade shape as the secret match_preview format change
    above, and the same accepted cost: a dismissal recorded against a real,
    fingerprint-capable line *before* this shipped stops matching once that
    finding is next scanned with a fingerprint attached, and needs dismissing
    once more.
