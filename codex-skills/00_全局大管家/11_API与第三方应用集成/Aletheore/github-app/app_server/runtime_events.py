"""Inbound webhook for Phase 3 - runtime-to-code evidence: lets a
customer's monitoring tool (Sentry, or anything producing
Sentry-compatible error events) report a real production failure. The
event gets resolved through the same failed-endpoint correlation chain
already proven for HTTP health checks (see
scan_worker.jobs.run_runtime_event_job) - one "zero-hop debugging" flow,
proven for a second real trigger rather than reimplemented.

Deliberately not an attempt to replace Sentry/every monitoring platform:
this ingests the one well-known event shape (exception.values[].
stacktrace.frames[], request.url/method - see aletheore.runtime_events)
and does one thing with it well.
