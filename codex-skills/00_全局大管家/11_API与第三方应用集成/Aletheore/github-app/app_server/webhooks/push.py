# GitHub's own compare-commits docs are explicit: "the list of changed
# files is only shown on the first page of results, and it includes up
# to 300 changed files for the entire comparison." page/per_page paginate
# the COMMITS in the response, not the files - confirmed directly against
# GitHub's docs (fetched twice, consistent both times). A prior version of
# this function looped page numbers expecting each page to carry the next
# slice of files, the way a normal paginated list endpoint works; in
# reality every page past the first comes back with no files at all, so
# the loop always terminated after page 1 regardless - it just silently
# capped at 300 changed files with no signal that more existed, on
# exactly the payloads (a mass rebase, a bulk import, a huge squash) most
# likely to actually exceed that cap. There is no documented way to
# retrieve file 301+ from this endpoint at all, so the fix here is a
# single request plus an honest, logged truncation warning - the same
# "silent truncation is not acceptable" standard this codebase applies
# everywhere else - not a way to actually retrieve the rest.
