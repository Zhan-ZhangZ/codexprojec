# gate. Kept separate from that module's own real bug (`_matches_command`
# alone, with no fence-awareness) found by the backward PR audit of
# #915-977: this file's /dismiss gate and _dismiss_reason both used to
# iterate body.splitlines() directly with no fence or indent awareness at
# all, never receiving the fence-awareness fix #949 gave the audit
# command - a maintainer replying with a fenced or indented example of
# "/dismiss" (quoting the command while discussing it, exactly the kind of
# thread this feature lives in) could silently dismiss a real finding with
# no intent to trigger it.

# an outside PR commenter (who this exists to stop) sits below.
