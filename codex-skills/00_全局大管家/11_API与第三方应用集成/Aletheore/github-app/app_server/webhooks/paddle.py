# Real gap found and fixed 2026-09-02, before this had ever been exercised
# by a real customer: this handler code has always understood
# "adjustment.created" (reverses an affiliate's commission on a refund or
# chargeback, see _handle_adjustment_created), but the live Paddle
# notification destination (Paddle dashboard > Developer tools >
# Notifications > "Paddle Webhook", ntfset_01kyksktbmvr49pyygmxa3vfjz) was
# never actually subscribed to it - confirmed directly via the Paddle API,
# not assumed from this file's own code. Code handling an event Paddle
# never delivers is invisible: no error, no log line, nothing - the
# handler simply never runs. A real refund or chargeback would have left
# the referring affiliate's commission un-reversed indefinitely.
#
# The events this file's code paths handle: transaction.completed,
# adjustment.created, adjustment.updated (the approval of a refund, which is
# when a top-up's credit is taken back), transaction.updated, and every name in
# _SUBSCRIPTION_EVENT_TYPES below. All of those except transaction.updated
# must always be a subset of the live destination's subscribed_events -
# transaction.updated is the deliberate exception: it's only checked for a
# refunded/partially_refunded/charged_back status, which Paddle's own
# adjustment.created already covers, so it's intentionally left
# unsubscribed live rather than added as a second path to the same
# reversal logic. Adding a new event_type branch to this file (other than
# that one deliberate exception) without also adding it to the live
# destination reproduces exactly the gap above - silently, with no test
# able to catch it, since nothing here can observe Paddle's own dashboard
# state.

# Every subscription lifecycle event that can change what plan an
# installation should be on. Previously only subscription.created was
# handled - a cancellation, a card declining until the subscription lapsed,
# or a tier change via Paddle's own customer portal all landed as one of
# these other event types and were silently dropped, leaving
# installations.plan stuck at whatever it was last set to indefinitely.
