"""Best-effort alerting for an unexpected, unhandled exception in
Aletheore's OWN backend - app_server routes and scan_worker jobs -
as opposed to runtime_events.py, which only ever ingests exceptions
from a *customer's* app. Before this, the only way to learn about a
crash here was reading logs after the fact (see: the event-loop
freeze bug, found reactively).

Reuses the existing Resend transactional-email infra rather than
standing up a separate error-tracking service - sends to
email_reply_to_address (support@aletheore.com), a real inbox someone
already checks. Also reports to Sentry (sentry_config.py) as a second,
independent channel - see send_error_alert's own comment for why that
call lives here rather than relying solely on LoggingIntegration.
