"""Body-size caps for inbound ingestion endpoints that accept a
caller-supplied payload the server would otherwise parse into memory before
any of its own validation runs.

The cap is enforced in middleware rather than inside the handler because by
the time a handler runs, FastAPI has already read and parsed the body - a
check there rejects a payload the process has fully materialized, which is
the cost the cap exists to avoid.

Caps are per-path and deliberately generous relative to real traffic: the
point is to make a hostile body impossible, not to police a legitimate one.
