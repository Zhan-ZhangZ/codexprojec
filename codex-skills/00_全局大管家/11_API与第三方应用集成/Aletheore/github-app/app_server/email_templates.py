"""Transactional email copy. Plain functions returning
{"subject", "html", "text"} - no templating engine, since these are a
handful of developer-authored, mostly-static messages with a few
interpolated variables, matching scan_worker/slack.py's format_* pattern
rather than pulling in a new dependency for it.

HTML is table-based (not flexbox/grid) with every style inlined, so it
renders consistently in Outlook desktop's Word engine as well as modern
webmail/mobile clients - not just the ones a browser preview would show.
