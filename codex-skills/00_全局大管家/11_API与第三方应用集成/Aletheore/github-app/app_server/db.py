    old flat cap used) only if period_start is genuinely NEWER than what's
    already on file for this installation; a no-op on a replayed,
    unrelated, or out-of-order (older) subscription.updated event.

    Paddle does not guarantee in-order webhook delivery - a retry of an
    older event can arrive after a newer one already committed. The guard
    used to be `current_billing_period_start IS DISTINCT FROM $3`, which
    only checks "different", not "later": a stale event with an OLDER
    period_start satisfied it too, silently re-running the reset with
    that older event's (possibly stale) plan/extra_seats, wiping out
    whatever the customer had already spent down in the real, newer
    period AND rewinding current_billing_period_start itself backward -
    which could then let the next genuine newer-period webhook re-fire
    the reset yet again. `IS NULL OR current_billing_period_start < $3`
    only ever advances the stored period forward (or sets it for the
    first time), so an older or equal event can never re-trigger this.
    Increments balance_epoch on a real reset, which doubles as the
    dedupe key both new credit-notification emails key off of. Returns
    whether a reset actually happened.

    Despite the parameter name/type, `pool` only needs to support
    `.fetchrow()` - webhooks/paddle.py passes an open `conn` acquired from
    an existing `pool.acquire()`/`conn.transaction()` block (the same
    pattern claim_free_to_paid_plan and friends already use) so this
    reset commits atomically with that block's plan/extra_seats/Paddle-id
    writes instead of as an independent standalone call.

    is_annual controls next_monthly_credit_reset_at: set to one month past
    this reset for an annual subscriber (see
    run_monthly_credit_reset_sweep_job in scan_worker/jobs.py, which
    resets base credit again every time that date arrives, independent of
    Paddle's own once-a-year billing period), or cleared to NULL for a
    monthly subscriber (whose base credit is already correctly refreshed
    every month by THIS function alone, so the synthetic sweep must never
    also touch them - both firing in the same month would double-credit).

    That first synthetic due date is period_start + 30 days rather than a
    true calendar month: python-dateutil's relativedelta would express
    "+ 1 month" exactly, but dateutil is not a dependency of this service
    (it appears in requirements.lock.txt only transitively, via croniter,
    and nothing in app_server/scan_worker imports it) and this fix is not
    worth adding one for. The tradeoff is small and bounded: only the
    FIRST interval of each year is 30 days - the sweep itself advances by
    a real `interval '1 month'` from its own previous due date afterwards
    - and the real annual renewal re-synchronizes this column from
    period_start every year, so the slight calendar drift can never
    accumulate beyond one billing year."""

    The per-seat bonus is folded into base_credit_for_plan, which only ever
    gets applied by a real renewal reset - and a seat purchase fires
    subscription.updated with the SAME current_billing_period.starts_at, so
    that reset is a deliberate no-op. Before this, a customer paid
    EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_USD ($6.99) for a seat and got $0 of extra credit until
    their next renewal, up to a month later; the old flat cap recomputed
    itself live from get_extra_seats at every enforcement call site, so
    raising the ceiling used to be immediate.

    Same `pool`-only-needs-`.execute()` contract reset_billing_period_credit

    block's plan/extra_seats/Paddle-id writes, rather than as a split write.

    balance_epoch is incremented, matching credit_topup_purchase: the
    balance just went UP, so a low-balance warning already sent for the old
    epoch must not suppress a later one for the new, larger allotment.

    `plan` and `extra_seats` are the installation's CURRENT (post-purchase)
    values, and base_credit_for_plan(plan, extra_seats) is therefore the
    ceiling this installation is actually entitled to right now. Clamping
    the credit at that ceiling - rather than adding the bonus
    unconditionally - is what closes a self-service farming ratchet: seat
    removal doesn't call this function and doesn't debit anything, so an
    unclamped `+=` let a customer remove and re-add the same seat over and
    over within one billing cycle, stacking a fresh EXTRA_SEAT_LLM_CAP_USD
    bonus every round-trip. With the clamp, no number of remove/re-add
    cycles can push the balance past what the current seat count pays for.
