# The AIR add-on for a seat beyond the plan's included count ($6.99/mo,
# pricing.html's "+$6.99/mo per additional team member"). Added as a second
# line item (by quantity) on a customer's existing AIR subscription, not a
# separate subscription of its own. Replaces the $4.99 price
# (pri_01kzks8ccwf6h5bxxtmjfdy1fg, now archived in Paddle), which itself
# replaced the original $3.99 price (pri_01kym2q99kevmdg7h71nwpm4ej, also
# archived) - each swap archived the old price rather than mutating it in
# place, and each was only done after confirming zero live subscribers on
# it, so no pre-existing subscriber was ever silently repriced. The included
# seat count for the "air" plan also dropped from 5 to 3 alongside this
# price change (db.py's INCLUDED_SEATS) - 5 seats was too much value to
# bundle into the base $29.99/mo price.

# Credit top-up - $1.15 USD/unit (1 unit = $1.00 of AI credit, the extra
# $0.15 is a service charge covering Paddle's fee), tax added on top
# (tax_mode "external"), one-time (not a subscription), customer-chosen
# quantity (5-1000, i.e. $5-$1000 of credit per purchase). Created live via
# the Paddle MCP on 2026-10-02. Product: pro_01m23jw9evjvn00a6gs276ynrw
# ("Aletheore Credit Top-up").
#
# It replaced the $1.00/unit price (pri_01m23jw9qbsnm4zmv28bfebx4t, tax
# mode "location"), which sold $1 of credit for $1 and left no room for
# Paddle's 5% + 50c fee, and in India (tax included) lost money on every
# small pack. The old price stays in LEGACY_CREDIT_TOPUP_PRICE_IDS so a
# checkout opened before the swap still credits; it is archived in Paddle
# only after the swap is deployed. Credit granted is quantity x the share
# of the subtotal actually collected, never the unit price, so this change
# needs no accounting change.

# The flash plan's real Paddle product (pro_01m1754jf8nkvhrn3sbaj9rmyq,
# "Aletheore Flash") and its one price - monthly only, no annual yet,
# matching what was actually validated (real cost/recall data checked
# against an 800-review cap - see llm_cost.py's PLAN_CAP_OVERRIDE_USD).
# Created live via the Paddle MCP, not a placeholder - real, chargeable
# as of 2026-08-29.
#
# $6/mo (pri_01m1754jr5msg62grry49kjhw5) replaced by $8/mo
# (pri_01m1dj0m1netz6ze1mmckz73nm) on 2026-09-01: the $6 price left thin
# worst-case margin once Paddle's cut was factored in against the
# measured ~$3.47 worst-case LLM cost for 800 reviews/month. Swapped
# rather than mutated in place (same pattern as EXTRA_SEAT_PRICE_ID's
# history above), only after confirming zero live subscribers on the old
# price via the Paddle MCP - it had only been live a few hours (PR #492)
# and never had a real subscriber, so there was nothing to migrate.
#
# $8/mo (pri_01m1dj0m1netz6ze1mmckz73nm) replaced by $10/mo
# (pri_01m3xpabbam5t2gkzwzmg0y9eq) on 2026-10-02: $8 left almost nothing
# after Paddle's fee, tax and the affiliate commission. Same swap pattern;
# zero active, trialing, past_due or paused subscribers were confirmed on
# the old price via the Paddle MCP before it was archived.
