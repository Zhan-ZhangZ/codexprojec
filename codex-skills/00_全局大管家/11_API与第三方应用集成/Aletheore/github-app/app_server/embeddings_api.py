"""Hosted embeddings for the CLI's semantic index.

Why this exists: `aletheore index` needs an embedding model, and the free
tier makes the user supply one - a local Ollama, or their own OpenAI key,
with a consent prompt before any code leaves the machine. Paid hosted
embeddings use the self-hosted Jina code model instead, so users get a
stronger code-retrieval model without installing a model server locally.

The gate is this endpoint returning 402, not a check inside the CLI. A
client-side check in an open-source binary is a suggestion; a server that
refuses unentitled callers is a gate. Same effort, and only one of them
survives someone reading the source.

Nothing is stored. Chunk text arrives, vectors go back, and the index lives
on the caller's disk. That is a deliberately smaller promise than "we index
your code": no retention policy to write, no deletion path to honour, and
nothing here for a subpoena to reach.
