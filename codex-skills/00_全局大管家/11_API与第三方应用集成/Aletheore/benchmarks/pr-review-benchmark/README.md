# Aletheore PR-Review Benchmark — Runbook

This benchmark measures Aletheore's grounding claim ("every finding traces back to evidence") against real competitors on real and reconstructed bugs, scored blind. This is a **named, 5-way comparison**: Aletheore (hosted Flash Review) vs. Qodo/PR-Agent vs. DeepSource vs. Sourcery vs. Greptile. This is a semi-automated, otherwise manual process; the runbook below describes every step.

CodeRabbit, Snyk Code, and Semgrep are excluded from this comparison entirely: each publishes a ToS clause barring benchmarking and/or publishing comparison results without prior written consent (confirmed by reading the actual ToS documents — Section 4.2(iv) for CodeRabbit, MSA Section 3.1(i) for Snyk Code, Section 2.3 for Semgrep — not a search summary, on 2026-09-13). CodeRabbit's Free-plan rate limits also made a fair, repeatable comparison impractical on their own. Sourcery and Greptile were checked the same way against their own published ToS and carry no such restriction. Bito and Korbit were included briefly (both cleared the same ToS check) but dropped again shortly after — not for a legal reason, but because both proved unreliable enough in practice (inconsistent PR-triggering behavior, dashboard failures) to undermine a fair, repeatable comparison. Since none of the remaining tools in this comparison need their output anonymized for legal reasons, this comparison runs **named, not blind-labeled** — every tool's output is scored under its real name. (Blind manual scoring of the ground-truth *judgment* — recall/false-positives/actionability — is still a good practice on its own merits, but tool identity no longer needs to be hidden from the scorer.)

Aletheore's real comparable feature is its hosted GitHub App's **Flash Review**, which posts findings as a PR comment from `aletheore[bot]` — not the CLI's whole-repo `aletheore audit` command, which is a different, non-comparable feature. Flash Review's model routing is `gpt-5.6-luna` primary (OpenAI), with `deepseek-v4-flash` as fallback and, on the AIR tier only, as a second-model verification pass over Luna's own output (see `github-app/scan_worker/model_tiers.py`) — not the single hardcoded DeepSeek model this doc originally described.

See `METHODOLOGY.md` for runtime values (model versions, dates, provider versions) recorded at execution time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI)
- Aletheore's GitHub App installed (paid plan) on the scratch repo, so Flash Review runs automatically on each PR
- DeepSource's GitHub App installed and configured on the scratch repo
- Sourcery's GitHub App ([github.com/marketplace/sourcery-ai](https://github.com/marketplace/sourcery-ai)) installed on the scratch repo
- Greptile's GitHub App ([greptile.com](https://www.greptile.com/)) installed on the scratch repo
- PR-Agent installed (`python -m pr_agent.cli`) — see PR-Agent setup section below
- OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable) — see model parity section below
- GitHub API token for accessing the scratch repo (typically `gh` auto-handles this)

## Step 0: Prepare Test Cases (One-Time Setup)

The benchmark corpus lives in `benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/cases/`, with one subdirectory per case. Cases must be authored before running the pipeline; see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-aletheore-pr-review-benchmark-design.md` → "Test Corpus & Ground Truth" for the full procedure, and refer to `cases/001-flask-cli-key-quote/` as a worked example.

**Each case directory must contain:**
- `repo.txt` — initially two lines: `repo_url=<https://github.com/...>` and `base_commit=<commit-hash>`. After opening the real PR in Step 1, append a third line: `pr_url=<the PR URL>` (see Step 3 for how to populate this after running tools)
- `pr.diff` — the PR diff (for real bugs, this is the *inverse* of the fix, reintroducing the bug)
- `ground_truth.yaml` — structured metadata: `case_id`, `language`, `category` (one of `real_bug_fix`, `injected_bug`, `clean`), `bug_type`, `expected_file`, `expected_line`, `fix_reference` (URL to the fix or `null`), and `description`
- `ground_truth.md` — 2–4 sentence prose explanation for the published report

For case authoring details, see the task 10 brief in `.superpowers/sdd/2026-07-26-aletheore-pr-review-benchmark-implementation-plan/task-10-brief.md`.

## Step 1: Open Real PR on Scratch Repo

The benchmark runs against real PRs opened on a **scratch repo** that you control, letting the tools see a genuine PR context (Aletheore's Flash Review and DeepSource are both hosted GitHub Apps that react to a real PR event).

**Scratch repo:** `https://github.com/ArihantK15/proctor-browser` (user controls; Aletheore's GitHub App — paid plan — and DeepSource's GitHub App are both already installed on it)

All 25 cases share this **one** scratch repo, so each case's files are nested under `benchmark-sandbox/<case-id>/` within it — this avoids collisions between concurrently-open case PRs (two cases could otherwise both touch `src/flask/cli.py` in the scratch repo's root and step on each other). Because of this nesting, every tool's cited file paths for a case come back prefixed with `benchmark-sandbox/<case-id>/` — `scripts/run_case.py`'s `_strip_sandbox_prefix()` strips it back off before the grounding check runs against the case's own standalone checkout.

**Each case PR needs its own base branch, not the scratch repo's default branch.** Real bug found via a Sourcery/Greptile pilot run (2026-09-13): opening the PR against the scratch repo's default branch means the PR's diff is the case's *entire* repo tree (100+ files on every real case checked — confirmed 103/131/150/213 on four different cases), not the real 1-file bug/fix `pr.diff` represents. That silently broke three separate things: Greptile hard-caps review at 100 changed files and skips the case entirely; Sourcery's own per-installation review-budget degrades a diff that size into a content-free "Approved" with no real findings; and `normalize_pr_agent`'s file attribution falls back to `None` whenever the PR's changed-file count isn't exactly 1 (silently true for every case under the old construction). `scripts/open_case_pr.py` fixes this by giving each case PR a real base branch of its own — a `seed/<case-id>` branch holding the case's full tree at `base_commit` (the "before" state), and a `fix/<case-id>` branch on top holding `base_commit` + `pr.diff` applied (the state under test) — so the PR's visible diff is exactly `pr.diff`, regardless of category.

For each case in the corpus:

1. Clone the scratch repo once (reuse this clone across cases):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArihantK15/proctor-browser /tmp/proctor-browser
   ```

2. Run `scripts/open_case_pr.py` for the case:
   ```bash
   cd benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark
   python3 -m scripts.open_case_pr cases/<case-id> /tmp/proctor-browser
   ```
   This materializes the case's `seed`/`fix` trees (checking out `base_commit`, then applying `pr.diff` on top — corpus fixture placeholders, e.g. case `020-express-hardcoded-webhook-secret`'s hardcoded-secret stand-in, are expanded in both trees automatically; see `scripts/fixtures.py` for why the corpus stores placeholders rather than the values themselves), pushes `seed/<case-id>` and `fix/<case-id>` to the scratch repo, opens the PR (`base=seed/<case-id>`, `head=fix/<case-id>`), and prints the PR URL. Append that URL to the case's own `repo.txt` as a third `pr_url=` line.

3. Wait for Aletheore's Flash Review, DeepSource, Sourcery, and Greptile to post their reviews (all four are hosted GitHub Apps that react to the PR automatically; may take a minute or two — Greptile in particular can take noticeably longer on a real diff than it did skip-checking an oversized one).

Re-running `scripts.open_case_pr` for a case already opened force-pushes both branches with the same content and is a safe no-op against an already-open PR (GitHub just shows "up to date" for it) — use this to re-open a case whose corpus source (`pr.diff`, `ground_truth.yaml`) changed after its PR was first opened.

## Step 2: Set Up Models — Model Parity (Luna)

The benchmark aims for **model parity** between Aletheore and PR-Agent: both use the same underlying LLM so the comparison isolates grounding architecture, not which LLM is smarter. This run uses **`gpt-5.6-luna`** (OpenAI) as the shared backend — Aletheore's own real, current primary model.

**Real bug fixed 2026-09-13:** this section used to point PR-Agent at DeepSeek (`deepseek-v4-flash`), true when this benchmark was first written (2026-07-26) but false since 2026-08-09, when production Flash Review switched to Luna as its primary model for every writing surface — specifically because DeepSeek V4 Flash wasn't catching enough real issues on PR review (see `model_tiers.py`'s own header comment). DeepSeek is now only Flash Review's fallback (no `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured) or, on the AIR tier, a second-model verification pass — never the model a real customer's Flash Review comment actually comes from. Comparing PR-Agent-on-DeepSeek against Aletheore-on-Luna wasn't isolating grounding architecture as this section's own framing claimed; it was confounding architecture with model choice, and not even a neutral confound, since Luna was deliberately chosen over DeepSeek for being the stronger PR reviewer.

**Do not point PR-Agent at its own default model (GPT-5.5) instead** — already tried, already measured at $6-7 for a 25-PR run, and rejected for that cost. Luna is not just more representative, it's cheaper too: $0.20/1M input, $1.20/1M output (`llm_cost.py`) against DeepSeek's own $0.44/$1.32.

### Environment Variables

Set once in your shell, or add to `.env` and `source` it:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-real-openai-api-key>"
```

### Aletheore Configuration

**Nothing to configure.** Aletheore's comparable feature in this benchmark is the hosted GitHub App's Flash Review, not the CLI's `audit` command — it runs automatically the moment a PR is opened on a repo with the app installed. Its model routing is `gpt-5.6-luna` primary (OpenAI), with `deepseek-v4-flash` as fallback and, on the AIR tier, as a verification pass (see `github-app/scan_worker/model_tiers.py`). There is no BYOK model config for it. Model parity with PR-Agent is achieved by pointing PR-Agent at this same real model, below.

### PR-Agent Configuration

`scripts/adapters.py`'s `pr_agent_adapter()` already invokes PR-Agent with `--config.model=gpt-5.6-luna` for parity with Aletheore's Flash Review. `gpt-5.6-luna` is a real OpenAI model (see `model_tiers.py`'s `writing_adapter_for`: `base_url=https://api.openai.com/v1`, no special routing), not an internal alias, so no provider prefix and no `OPENAI_API_BASE` override are needed — PR-Agent's default OpenAI endpoint is already the right one:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-real-openai-api-key>"
```

Refer to PR-Agent's official documentation if `--config.model` needs a different key format for your installed version.

PR-Agent also needs its own GitHub token, separate from `gh`'s: without it, the CLI fails with `GitHub token is required when using user deployment`. Set it via PR-Agent's own (dynaconf) config key, `github.user_token`:

```bash
export GITHUB__USER_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"
```

## Step 3: Run the Case Pipeline

For each case, run `scripts/run_case.py`. This orchestrates:
1. Clone the repo at `base_commit`
2. Apply the case's `pr.diff`
3. Invoke each adapter (Aletheore, PR-Agent, DeepSource)
4. Normalize raw output to the common schema
5. Run the automated grounding check, at both levels (see below)
6. Store results in `results/raw/`, `results/grounding/`

### The two grounding levels

`scripts/check_citations.py` scores every tool at two levels, identically:

- **Location grounding** (`grounding_rate`) — the cited file exists and the cited line is inside it. This is a low bar: a static analyser reporting its own AST positions clears it by construction, so a rate of 1.0 is close to uninformative.
- **Content grounding** (`content_grounding_rate`) — text the finding quotes verbatim actually appears near the line it cites. This is the bar Aletheore's Flash Review enforces on *itself* in production (`_line_citation_content_matches` drops findings that fail it), and it's what the grounding claim is really about.

Measuring only the first level made this benchmark structurally unable to show that difference, and actively unfair: competitors scored full grounding credit for clearing a bar Aletheore voluntarily exceeds, while Aletheore's stricter internal check removed findings and depressed its own recall. Findings that quote nothing verbatim can't be scored at the content level and are excluded from its denominator rather than counted either way.

### Collecting Tool Outputs

The adapters in `scripts/adapters.py` accept injected callables so you can fetch each tool's real output without hardcoding API logic in the adapter itself. Populate these as follows:

#### PR-Agent

Runs locally via `subprocess.run()`, but its `review` command posts its output as a PR comment rather than printing it to stdout — `pr_agent_adapter()` takes a `fetch_review` callable to retrieve that comment after invoking the CLI. See the wiring example below.

#### Aletheore

**Real bug fixed 2026-09-13:** this section used to say Flash Review "posts as a plain PR comment (not a per-line review comment)... containing inline `file:line` citations in its prose" - true when this benchmark was first written, false now. A real finding posts as a per-line PR **review** comment (path/line - the same shape DeepSource/Sourcery/Greptile already use, and the clickable-suggestion-capable surface), with the issue comment reduced to a summary ("N finding(s) posted as inline review comment(s) below." or "No issues found in this diff."). Fetching only the issue-comments endpoint (the old behavior) silently scored every real finding as a miss - measured directly on this benchmark's own run: 6 of 7 sampled cases had a real finding sitting in a review comment, none of them counted. `aletheore_adapter()` fetches **both** surfaces, matching Greptile's own dual-surface pattern - see that adapter's own docstring:

```python
import re
import subprocess
import json

def fetch_issue_comments(pr_url):
    match = re.match(r"https://github.com/(.+)/(.+)/pull/(\d+)", pr_url)
    owner, repo, number = match.groups()
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["gh", "api", f"repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments"],
        capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
    )
    return json.loads(result.stdout)

def fetch_review_comments(pr_url):
    match = re.match(r"https://github.com/(.+)/(.+)/pull/(\d+)", pr_url)
    owner, repo, number = match.groups()
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["gh", "api", f"repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments"],
        capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
    )
    return json.loads(result.stdout)
```

#### DeepSource

1. **DeepSource's GitHub App is already installed** on the scratch repo and will post reviews to each PR automatically.

2. **Fetch DeepSource's PR comments**: unlike Aletheore's, DeepSource posts ordinary GitHub PR *review* comments (path/line/body attached to a specific diff line) — fetch via the **PR review comments** endpoint and let `deepsource_adapter()` filter to the bot's own comments:

   ```python
   def fetch_review_comments(pr_url):
       match = re.match(r"https://github.com/(.+)/(.+)/pull/(\d+)", pr_url)
       owner, repo, number = match.groups()
       result = subprocess.run(
           ["gh", "api", f"repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments"],
           capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
       )
       return json.loads(result.stdout)
   ```

#### Sourcery

1. **Sourcery's GitHub App is already installed** on the scratch repo. Sourcery has its own per-installation review-budget rate limit (diff characters per rolling 7 days) independent of this benchmark's own pacing — if a case's Sourcery review comes back empty, check the PR for a budget-exhausted message before treating it as a true negative.

2. **Fetch Sourcery's PR review comments**: Sourcery's real per-line findings are GitHub PR *review* comments (path present, `line` frequently null), each opening with a bold category label (`**nitpick:**`, `**issue (bug_risk):**` per Sourcery's own docs). Sourcery also posts a review-level summary via the separate `pulls/{number}/reviews` endpoint, but in every real PR sampled while verifying this its body was just "Approved"/rate-limit boilerplate — `sourcery_adapter()` does not fetch it. Reuse `fetch_review_comments` and let `sourcery_adapter()` filter to `sourcery-ai[bot]`.

#### Greptile

1. **Greptile's GitHub App is already installed** on the scratch repo and will post reviews to each PR automatically.

2. **Fetch both of Greptile's comment surfaces**: unlike every other tool above, Greptile posts to both at once on the same PR — a prose summary ("Greptile Summary", a confidence score) as a plain issue comment, and per-line findings (a P1-P4 priority badge, path/line) as PR review comments. `greptile_adapter()` takes both fetchers (`fetch_issue_comments` from the Aletheore section above, `fetch_review_comments` from the DeepSource section) and returns `{"issue_comments": [...], "review_comments": [...]}`; `normalize_greptile()` only turns the review comments into gradeable findings (the issue comment is PR-level prose with no per-location claim to check against ground truth) but both are kept in the raw output as context for the manual scoring step.

3. **Note on output storage**: All intermediate results (raw tool outputs, grounding checks, manual scores, LLM judge scores) are **working state, not published artifacts**. The entire `benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/results/` directory is `.gitignore`d and stays local to your machine.

   The published deliverables are only:
   - `benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/REPORT.md` — the final scored summary
   - `benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/METHODOLOGY.md` — runtime metadata
   - `benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/cases/` — the test corpus (contains no tool outputs, only ground truth)

   Since every tool in this comparison is named (no ToS-restricted vendor), the local-only convention for `results/` is now purely to avoid publishing noisy intermediate/raw data — not a legal requirement.

### Running the Pipeline

Create a script (or run interactively) that:

```python
import json
import re
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path
from scripts.run_case import run_case
from scripts.adapters import (
    aletheore_adapter, pr_agent_adapter, deepsource_adapter,
    sourcery_adapter, greptile_adapter,
)
from scripts.normalize import (
    normalize_aletheore, normalize_pr_agent, normalize_deepsource,
    normalize_sourcery, normalize_greptile,
)

def _pr_number_and_repo(pr_url):
    match = re.match(r"https://github.com/(.+)/(.+)/pull/(\d+)", pr_url)
    return match.group(1), match.group(2), match.group(3)

def fetch_issue_comments(pr_url):
    # Aletheore's Flash Review posts a plain PR/issue comment (see README's
    # "Aletheore" subsection above for why this differs from DeepSource's).
    owner, repo, number = _pr_number_and_repo(pr_url)
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["gh", "api", f"repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments"],
        capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
    )
    return json.loads(result.stdout)

def fetch_review_comments(pr_url):
    # DeepSource posts ordinary GitHub PR *review* comments (path/line/body).
    owner, repo, number = _pr_number_and_repo(pr_url)
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["gh", "api", f"repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments"],
        capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
    )
    return json.loads(result.stdout)

def fetch_pr_agent_review(pr_url):
    # PR-Agent's `review` command also posts its output as a PR comment
    # rather than printing JSON to stdout -- see scripts/normalize.py's
    # normalize_pr_agent for the real comment shape.
    owner, repo, number = _pr_number_and_repo(pr_url)
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["gh", "api", f"repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments"],
        capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
    )
    comments = json.loads(result.stdout)
    pr_agent_comment = next(c for c in comments if "PR Reviewer Guide" in c.get("body", ""))
    changed_files_result = subprocess.run(
        ["gh", "api", f"repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/files", "--jq", ".[].filename"],
        capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
    )
    changed_files = changed_files_result.stdout.splitlines()
    return {"comment_body": pr_agent_comment["body"], "changed_files": changed_files}

# Run one case
case_dir = Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/cases/001-flask-cli-key-quote")
workdir = Path("/tmp/pr-review-benchmark/work")
results_dir = Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/results")

adapters = {
    "aletheore": lambda checkout_dir, case: aletheore_adapter(
        checkout_dir, case, fetch_pr_comments=fetch_issue_comments, fetch_pr_review_comments=fetch_review_comments
    ),
    "pr_agent": lambda checkout_dir, case: pr_agent_adapter(checkout_dir, case, fetch_review=fetch_pr_agent_review),

    # as DeepSource - reuses fetch_review_comments as-is.
    "sourcery": lambda checkout_dir, case: sourcery_adapter(checkout_dir, case, fetch_pr_review_comments=fetch_review_comments),
    # Greptile posts to both surfaces on the same PR - see its README
    # subsection above for why both fetchers are needed here.
    "greptile": lambda checkout_dir, case: greptile_adapter(
        checkout_dir, case, fetch_pr_comments=fetch_issue_comments, fetch_pr_review_comments=fetch_review_comments
    ),
}

normalizers = {
    "aletheore": normalize_aletheore,
    "pr_agent": normalize_pr_agent,
    "deepsource": normalize_deepsource,
    "sourcery": normalize_sourcery,
    "greptile": normalize_greptile,
}

result = run_case(case_dir, workdir, results_dir, adapters, normalizers)
print(f"Case {result['case_id']} processed; results in {results_dir}/raw/{result['case_id']}/")
```

**Output structure after running all cases:**
```
benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/results/
  raw/<case-id>/              # (all local/uncommitted working state)
    aletheore.json            # tool's raw output (bot-filtered PR comments)
    pr_agent.json
    deepsource.json
  grounding/<case-id>/        # (all local/uncommitted working state)
    aletheore.json            # grounding check: {total_findings, verified, unverified, grounding_rate}
    pr_agent.json
    deepsource.json
```

## Step 4: Manual Scoring

This is a **named** comparison, not a blind-labeled one: since CodeRabbit is out of scope entirely, there's no ToS-driven reason to hide tool identity, so findings are scored under each tool's real name (`aletheore`, `pr_agent`, `deepsource`). Read the findings in `results/raw/<case-id>/` (normalized via `results/grounding/<case-id>/` for the automated file/line check) alongside the ground truth in `cases/<case-id>/ground_truth.yaml` and `ground_truth.md`, and score each tool independently.

For each case, create `results/scored/<case-id>.yaml`:

```yaml
case_id: 001-flask-cli-key-quote
scores:
  aletheore:
    recall: "hit"  # or "partial" / "miss"
    false_positives: []  # list of findings that are NOT the ground-truth issue
    actionability: 5  # 1–5 scale
  pr_agent:
    recall: "partial"
    false_positives:
      - "suggestion about quote handling in a different context, not the _validate_key bug"
    actionability: 3
  deepsource:
    recall: "miss"
    false_positives: []
    actionability: null
```

**Scoring definitions:**
- **recall**: Did the tool find the ground-truth issue?
  - `"hit"` — yes, the finding directly points to the buggy line/function
  - `"partial"` — yes, but the finding is vague or requires reading between the lines
  - `"miss"` — no, the tool didn't flag anything about the bug
- **false_positives**: List any findings that are NOT the ground-truth issue and are NOT legitimate secondary issues (e.g., related but distinct bugs). Include the finding message for clarity.
- **actionability**: On a 1–5 scale, is the finding specific enough to act on?
  - 1 = generic advice ("improve error handling")
  - 5 = actionable ("fix the missing double quote on line 798")
  - `null` if no finding was made (no actionability to score)

### Template Generation

To generate blank scorecards for all cases:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from scripts.scoring_template import write_blank_scorecard

results_dir = Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/results")
TOOL_NAMES = ["aletheore", "pr_agent", "deepsource"]
for raw_dir in sorted((results_dir / "raw").glob("*")):
    case_id = raw_dir.name
    out_path = results_dir / "scored" / f"{case_id}.yaml"
    write_blank_scorecard(case_id, TOOL_NAMES, out_path)
    print(f"Created {out_path}")
```

## Step 5: LLM Judge — Claude Subagent

The benchmark includes a second, independent scoring pass by an LLM judge to measure human/LLM agreement and catch reviewer fatigue. The judge must be a **different provider/family** than the models under test (Aletheore and PR-Agent both use DeepSeek in this run, so the judge is Claude, a different provider). It is given real tool names, not anonymized labels — this is a named comparison (see Step 4).

**Important: The judge is NOT an API call.** Instead, this is a **Claude subagent dispatch** from a Claude Code session (your CLI agent acts as the controller):

1. **Build the judge prompt** for a case using `scripts/llm_judge.py`:
   ```python
   from scripts.llm_judge import build_judge_prompt
   import json
   import yaml
   from pathlib import Path
   
   case_id = "001-flask-cli-key-quote"
   ground_truth = yaml.safe_load((Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/cases") / case_id / "ground_truth.yaml").read_text())
   
   # Use results/grounding/ (normalized findings), not results/raw/ (raw tool
   # API responses -- full GitHub comment objects with avatar URLs, HTML diff
   # hunks, etc.). Passing raw/ directly bloats the judge prompt by ~80x with
   # no benefit (confirmed via a live dry run: 233KB vs 2.9KB for one case)
   # and dilutes the judge's attention with irrelevant metadata.
   grounding_dir = Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/results/grounding") / case_id
   findings_by_tool = {}
   for tool_file in sorted(grounding_dir.glob("*.json")):
       data = json.loads(tool_file.read_text())
       findings_by_tool[tool_file.stem] = data["verified"] + data["unverified"]
   
   prompt = build_judge_prompt(ground_truth, findings_by_tool)
   ```

2. **Dispatch a fresh Claude subagent** with this prompt:
   - In your Claude Code CLI session, use the Agent tool to spawn a `"general-purpose"` or similar fresh agent
   - Pass the full `prompt` from step 1 as the agent's task
   - The subagent has no information except the prompt; it does not see this runbook or the case structure

3. **Capture the subagent's response** and parse it:
   ```python
   from scripts.llm_judge import parse_judge_response
   
   # Assume you received the judge's response text
   judge_response = """... the subagent's JSON response ..."""
   scores = parse_judge_response(judge_response)
   
   # Save to results/llm_judged/<case_id>.json
   import json
   out_path = Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/results/llm_judged") / f"{case_id}.json"
   out_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
   out_path.write_text(json.dumps(scores, indent=2))
   ```

**Note**: The design originally included an optional `scripts/llm_judge.py` → `call_judge_model()` function that uses an OpenAI-style client. This is **not used in the real run** (it's tested code but doesn't execute here); the blind subagent dispatch above is the actual procedure for the benchmark.

## Step 6: Aggregate Scores & Build Report

After scoring all cases (both manual and LLM), aggregate the results and render the final report.

### Aggregate Scores

```python
from scripts.aggregate import load_manual_scores, load_llm_scores, load_case_label_maps, build_scorecard
from pathlib import Path
import json

results_dir = Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/results")

manual_scores = load_manual_scores(results_dir)
llm_scores = load_llm_scores(results_dir)
# No results/sealed/ directory exists in this named (non-anonymized) run, so
# this returns {} and build_scorecard falls back to using each scored.yaml's
# keys directly as the real tool name (see scripts/aggregate.py's
# `label_to_tool.get(label, label)` fallback).
case_label_maps = load_case_label_maps(results_dir)

scorecard = build_scorecard(manual_scores, llm_scores, case_label_maps)

# Save scorecard
scorecard_path = results_dir / "scorecard.json"
scorecard_path.write_text(json.dumps(scorecard, indent=2))
print(f"Scorecard saved to {scorecard_path}")
```

### Load Grounding Results & Merge

```python
from scripts.build_report import merge_grounding_into_scorecard, render_report_markdown
import json
from pathlib import Path

results_dir = Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/results")

# Load the scorecard built in the previous step
scorecard = json.loads((results_dir / "scorecard.json").read_text())

# Load grounding results (automated check of file/line citations)
grounding_by_case_and_tool = {}
for grounding_file in sorted((results_dir / "grounding").glob("*/*.json")):
    case_id = grounding_file.parent.name
    tool = grounding_file.stem
    grounding_data = json.loads(grounding_file.read_text())
    grounding_by_case_and_tool.setdefault(case_id, {})[tool] = grounding_data

# Merge grounding into scorecard
final_scorecard = merge_grounding_into_scorecard(scorecard, grounding_by_case_and_tool)

# Render markdown report
report_md = render_report_markdown(final_scorecard)
print(report_md)

# Save to REPORT.md
report_path = Path("benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/REPORT.md")
report_path.write_text(report_md)
```

### Final Report Output

The report includes:
- A summary table: recall (hit/partial/miss), false-positive count, avg actionability, and **two** grounding rates per tool
- Human/LLM judge agreement rates (per rubric dimension)
- Known limitations (reproduced from the design spec)
- Methodology (dates, model versions, provider info — to be filled into `METHODOLOGY.md` at execution time)

## Step 7: Fill in METHODOLOGY.md

Before publishing, record runtime values in `benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/METHODOLOGY.md`:

```markdown
- **Run date:** YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM UTC
- **Aletheore version/model:** git commit hash (github-app deployment), `gpt-5.6-luna` primary / `deepseek-v4-flash` fallback (Flash Review, see `model_tiers.py` — confirm which one actually ran per `OPENAI_API_KEY` availability at run time)
- **PR-Agent version/model:** pip freeze output, `gpt-5.6-luna`
- **DeepSource plan/version:** as displayed in Settings (e.g., "Team plan, v2026-07-26")
- **LLM judge model:** Claude (subagent dispatch, no separate API key)
- **Corpus:** 25 cases — 15 real bug-fix reconstructions, 6 injected bugs, 4 clean PRs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Aletheore's Flash Review hasn't posted a comment

Confirm the Aletheore GitHub App is installed on the scratch repo under the account/org that's actually paid (installations are per-account — see `github-app/app_server/dashboard.py`'s `_uninitialized_repos_for_installation` for how the dashboard resolves this). Flash Review only runs for paid installations; check the app's own logs (`docker compose logs scan_worker` on the production host) if it's installed but silent.

### DeepSource isn't connected

Ensure the scratch repo (`ArihantK15/proctor-browser`) is connected to DeepSource and has run an analysis. Verify in DeepSource's UI that it's scanning the repo.

### PR-Agent command not found

Ensure PR-Agent is installed:
```bash
pip install pr-agent
python -m pr_agent.cli --help
```

If it's not, install it and configure `.pr_agent.toml` per the PR-Agent setup section above.

## Reproducibility & Auditing

To verify results later:

1. Re-run the pipeline against the same cases (files in `benchmarks/pr-review-benchmark/cases/`) — git log records the exact case authors and dates
2. Check raw tool outputs in `results/raw/` to audit individual findings (scored under real tool names — see Step 4)
3. Verify grounding results in `results/grounding/` to confirm file/line citations

All inputs (cases, raw outputs, human scores, LLM scores) are stored locally in `results/`. This directory is gitignored to keep noisy intermediate data out of the published deliverables (`REPORT.md`, `METHODOLOGY.md`, `cases/`), not because of any tool's ToS.
