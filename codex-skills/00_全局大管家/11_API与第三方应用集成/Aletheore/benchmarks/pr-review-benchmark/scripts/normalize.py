    Primary source is review_comments (path/line-anchored, exactly like

    extraction over the issue comments' own text as a second, defensive
    pass - not because the current format needs it (a real Flash Review
    issue comment is just a summary now, with no citations of its own to
    find), but because trusting a comment-format description that had
    already gone stale once, silently, is exactly the failure mode this
    fix exists to close - a future format change reintroducing prose
    citations must not silently go back to being invisible here. Findings
