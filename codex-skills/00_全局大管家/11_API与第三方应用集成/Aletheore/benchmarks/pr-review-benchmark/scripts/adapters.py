"""Real per-tool invocation. Each adapter takes (checkout_dir, case,
...) and returns raw output ready for scripts/normalize.py. Adapters
that shell out or call an API accept an injectable runner/fetcher so
command construction is unit-testable without actually invoking
external tools or the network.

Aletheore's real comparable feature is its hosted GitHub App's Flash
Review (deepseek-v4-flash), not the CLI's whole-repo `audit` -- it posts
findings as a PR comment from aletheore[bot], fetched and bot-filtered
the same way as DeepSource's GitHub App comments. CodeRabbit, Snyk Code,
and Semgrep are excluded from this benchmark entirely -- their published
ToS bar benchmarking and/or publishing comparison results without prior
written consent (confirmed by reading the actual ToS documents, not a
search summary, on 2026-09-13). Sourcery and Greptile were checked the
same way and carry no such restriction. Bito and Korbit adapters existed
here briefly too (both cleared the same ToS check) but were dropped --
not for a legal reason, but both proved too unreliable in practice
(inconsistent PR-triggering behavior, dashboard failures) for a fair,
repeatable comparison.

Bot logins below were each confirmed against a real, finding-bearing
public PR (not guessed from marketing copy or a GitHub App's own display
name, which frequently differs from its actual commenting bot account) --
see the comment above each adapter for the specific PR checked.

    """Real bug found and fixed 2026-09-13: this used to fetch only the
    issue-comments endpoint, matching the README's original description
    of Flash Review ("posts as a plain PR comment... containing inline
    file:line citations in its prose"). That's no longer how it posts a
    real finding - confirmed directly against this benchmark's own live
    run: a finding now goes out as a real per-line PR *review* comment
    (path/line, exactly the same shape DeepSource/Sourcery/Greptile
    already use, and the same clickable-suggestion-capable surface this
    session built and verified tonight), with the issue comment reduced
    to a summary ("N finding(s) posted as inline review comment(s)
    below" or "No issues found in this diff.") that carries no citations
    of its own to extract.

    Real, measured impact of the old fetch-only-issue-comments code:
    sampled 7 consecutive real cases from this exact run - 6 of 7 had a
    genuine Aletheore finding sitting in a review comment, all silently
    scored as 0 findings ("miss") because the old adapter never looked
    there. Only the 1 case that genuinely found nothing ("No issues
    found in this diff.", no review comment to have) was ever scored
    correctly by accident. Every prior benchmark run measuring Aletheore
    likely undercounted its real recall the same way.

    Matches greptile_adapter's own dual-surface pattern (issue comments
    are prose/summary, review comments are the gradeable findings) -
    normalize_aletheore treats the review comments as the real findings
    and the issue comment as supplementary context, not a second source
    of the same citations.

    Flash Review" - true when this benchmark was first written
    (2026-07-26), false since 2026-08-09, when production Flash Review
    switched to gpt-5.6-luna (OpenAI) as its primary model for every
    writing surface, specifically because DeepSeek V4 Flash wasn't
    catching enough real issues on PR review (see model_tiers.py's own
    header comment) - DeepSeek is now only Flash Review's fallback (no
    OPENAI_API_KEY) or, on the AIR tier, a second-model verification
    pass, never the primary generator a real customer's comment comes
    from. Comparing PR-Agent-on-DeepSeek against Aletheore-on-Luna
    wasn't isolating grounding architecture as the "model parity"
    framing claimed - it was confounding architecture with model choice,
    and not even a neutral confound, since Luna was deliberately chosen
    over DeepSeek for being the stronger PR reviewer.

    gpt-5.6-luna is a real OpenAI model (see model_tiers.py's
    writing_adapter_for: base_url=https://api.openai.com/v1, no special
    routing), not an internal alias, so no provider prefix here - unlike
    the old deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash config, which needed LiteLLM's
    "deepseek/" prefix to route through DeepSeek's own OpenAI-compatible
    endpoint. Also cheaper on input than DeepSeek's own model
    (llm_cost.py: $0.20/1M input, $1.20/1M output for Luna vs. $0.44/
    $1.32 for deepseek-v4-flash) - nowhere near PR-Agent's own default
