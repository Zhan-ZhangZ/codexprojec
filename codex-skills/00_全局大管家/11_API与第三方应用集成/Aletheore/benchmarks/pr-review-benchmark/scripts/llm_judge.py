"""Independent LLM scoring pass: builds a rubric prompt from each
tool's findings and ground truth, and parses the model's structured
response into scoring_template.py's score shape. The judge model must
be a different provider/family than whichever model powers the tools
under test in a given run (see METHODOLOGY.md).

This is a named comparison (see README.md) -- CodeRabbit was dropped
and there's no ToS-driven reason left to hide tool identity from the
judge, so findings_by_tool is keyed by each tool's real name
(aletheore, pr_agent, deepsource), not an anonymized Tool A/B/C/D
label."""
