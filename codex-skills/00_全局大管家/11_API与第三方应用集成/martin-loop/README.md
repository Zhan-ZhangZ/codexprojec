# MartinLoop

**Give coding agents more work. Watch them less. Ship more.**

MartinLoop lets you give coding agents real software jobs without babysitting every step.

Your coding agent still writes the code. MartinLoop keeps the job focused, bounded, and accountable — with limits, stop conditions, verification, recovery, and a clear outcome when the run ends.

  **Trust your coding agents with real work.**

  Built from thousands of agent runs where the problem was not just intelligence — it was whether you could give the agent a real job and confidently walk away.

  **Measure your loop tax:** `npx -y martin-loop@latest audit`  
  **Get started:** `npx -y martin-loop@latest start`  
  **Try the demo:** `npx -y martin-loop@latest demo`

## Start Here

**Audit first** — run `npx -y martin-loop@latest audit` to see how much API-equivalent Claude Code spend went into fix-and-retry loops. Add `--offline` for zero network access or `--share` for a shareable summary.

**Install / onboard** — run `npx -y martin-loop@latest start`, or install it globally with `npm install -g martin-loop@latest`.

**Governed run** — define an objective, verifier, budget, and iteration cap with `martin run`.

**Verifier** — completion requires fresh verifier evidence bound to the active run and workspace. A configured verifier proves only the checks it runs; `VERIFIED` is not a claim that the code is bug-free or automatically safe to merge.

**Budget** — set a hard spend ceiling with `--budget-usd` and an attempt ceiling with `--max-iterations`.

**Receipts** — inspect the latest result with `martin dossier --latest` and validate stored integrity with `martin runs verify --latest`.

**Hosted sync (optional)** — governed work is local-first. Configure `MARTIN_API_TOKEN` and `MARTIN_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`, then use `martin sync status` and `martin sync flush` to send preserved evidence to a dashboard later. See the [quickstart](./docs/getting-started/quickstart.md#optional-hosted-dashboard-sync).

**MCP** — install `@martinloop/mcp@latest` in a supported host or generate host configuration with `martin mcp print-config`.

**Documentation** — continue with the [quickstart](./docs/getting-started/quickstart.md), [CLI reference](./docs/reference/cli.md), or [MCP setup](./docs/getting-started/mcp.md).

When `--model` is provided, MartinLoop passes it through unchanged. Without `--model`, the authenticated host runtime chooses its own default. MartinLoop does not inject a hidden fallback model.

## For AI Agents

MartinLoop is the system around the coding job.

The coding agent still writes the code. MartinLoop keeps the job, limits, verification, recovery, outcome, and history consistent around the work.

Use MartinLoop when a coding task needs:

- clear job and success criteria
- preflight readiness before agent spend
- hard budget and iteration limits
- allowed or denied edit scope
- controlled retries and stop conditions
- independent verifier commands
- recovery and rollback evidence
- a finite completion decision
- run receipts, dossiers, history, failure classification, and post-run analysis
- one consistent workflow across supported coding-agent runtimes

Canonical lifecycle:

```text
DEFINE
  -> PREFLIGHT
  -> CONTROL
  -> VERIFY
  -> RECOVER
  -> PROVE
  -> ANALYZE
```

The product-level flow is **Definition of Done -> Controlled Run -> Verified Handoff**.

For machine-readable context start with [`llms.txt`](./llms.txt), [`llms-full.txt`](./llms-full.txt), and [MartinLoop for AI Agents](./docs/for-agents.md).

## One System Around the Run

Teams should not need to stitch together a separate script or point tool for every part of coding-agent execution. MartinLoop connects the control path around the agent from preflight through post-run evidence.

| Stage | MartinLoop role |
| --- | --- |
| Define | Capture the objective, verifier, budget, scope, and finish line. |
| Preflight | Check readiness and required workflow evidence before agent spend. |
| Control | Enforce budgets, attempts, path boundaries, policy, and stop conditions while the coding agent works. |
| Verify | Run configured checks and bind the evidence to the active run and workspace. |
| Recover | Preserve recovery and rollback state when another attempt or human review is required. |
| Prove | Produce the authoritative `VERIFIED`, `STOPPED`, or `NEEDS REVIEW` handoff plus receipts. |
| Analyze | Inspect run history, cost provenance, failure classes, dossiers, and shareable evidence after execution. |

MartinLoop does not replace Git, GitHub, CI, dedicated security scanners, observability platforms, code review, or the coding agent itself. It gives those workflows one governed execution record to inspect.

### Change the worker. Keep the job.

MartinLoop is model-agnostic by design. The job, limits, verification, recovery, and outcome are separate from the worker underneath.

Native coding-agent CLIs and OpenAI-compatible model runtimes use different execution paths, so MartinLoop only describes a worker as fully supported when that execution path has been publicly released and validated.

## Why MartinLoop

AI coding agents can create more software than ever. The problem is trusting them with bigger jobs without turning yourself into their full-time manager.

Agents drift. They retry. They break unrelated things. They say "done" too early. And a run that was supposed to save time can create even more work to review.

MartinLoop keeps the job accountable outside the agent itself: clear boundaries, hard limits, configured checks, recovery information, and an explicit outcome.

The goal is simple:

**Give the agent more responsibility without giving it unlimited freedom.**

## Why Teams Adopt MartinLoop

- **Less babysitting** — give agents larger jobs without watching every step.
- **Clear boundaries** — keep scope, attempts, and spend inside the limits you set.
- **Checks before "done"** — configured verification decides whether the evidence passed.
- **Understand failures** — know why the run stopped instead of digging through logs.
- **Recover cleanly** — preserve enough evidence to retry, repair, roll back, or hand off.
- **One workflow across agents** — keep the job consistent as the worker underneath changes.

**More software. Less supervision.**

## See Your Loop Tax

Before changing your workflow, measure it:

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 audit
```

MartinLoop reads Claude Code session history locally and reports how much API-equivalent agent spend happened inside fix-and-retry loops, how often verifier commands failed, the longest retry chain, and sessions that ended red. Session contents stay local. Use `--offline` to disable even the public pricing lookup, and `--share` to create a screenshot-ready SVG plus Markdown summary.

Then put limits around the next run:

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 run "<task>" --verify "npm test" --budget-usd 2 --max-iterations 3
```

## 2-Minute Install Path

If MartinLoop detects more than one supported coding-agent runtime, save the one you want to use before the first governed run. For example:

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@latest enable --engine codex
```

Replace `codex` with `claude` or `gemini` when that is your intended runtime.

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@latest start
npx -y martin-loop@latest demo
cd martin-loop-demo
npm install
npx -y martin-loop@latest run "Summarize the demo workspace and prove tests still pass" --verify "npm test" --budget-usd 2 --max-iterations 1
```

## Quick Start

Try MartinLoop in a disposable demo workspace:

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@latest start
npx -y martin-loop@latest demo
npx -y martin-loop@latest --version
cd martin-loop-demo
npm install
npx -y martin-loop@latest run "Summarize the demo workspace and prove tests still pass" --verify "npm test" --budget-usd 2 --max-iterations 1
npx -y martin-loop@latest dossier --latest
npx -y martin-loop@latest share --latest
```

Optional global install:

```sh
npm install -g martin-loop
martin-loop --version
```

If this flow is useful, open an issue with feedback so we can keep improving the public experience.

`start` prints the first-run guided path. `run` auto-checks `doctor`, `session-start`, and `preflight`, then executes when the environment is ready. Use `--proof` only when you intentionally want an explicit no-spend lane.

Inspect-first flow:

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@latest doctor
npx -y martin-loop@latest session-start
npx -y martin-loop@latest preflight "Summarize the demo workspace and prove tests still pass" --verify "npm test"
```

`share --latest` writes three files into the selected run directory under `share/`: `run-receipt.json`, `run-receipt.md`, and `proof-card.svg`.

## Swarm Mode Demo

Run the deterministic 15-agent launch-board demo without provider calls or spend:

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 demo --swarm
```

The demo shows bounded concurrency, parent-controlled integration, reassignment and recovery, rejected-change isolation, inspectable evidence, and one parent/global verification result. Provider-backed live Swarm execution is not part of the 0.8.0 public CLI.

## Model and Engine Support

MartinLoop governs the job independently of the coding worker.

- Native agent CLIs: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI
- OpenAI-compatible endpoints: Kimi K2, NVIDIA Nemotron, DeepSeek, Qwen/Qwen Coder, Mistral/Codestral, OpenRouter/Together/Fireworks routes, Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, and other compatible endpoints
- Use `--engine openai` for OpenAI-compatible model endpoints.

The worker changes; MartinLoop's budget, scope, verifier, receipt, and integrity contract does not.

More detail: [Model and engine support](./docs/reference/model-support.md)

## The Run From Start to Handoff

MartinLoop's terminal presentation is built around the governed lifecycle, not around a single verifier command.

**Governed Run Plan** shows the configured finish line before work starts, including the task, budget posture, verifier plan, scope, and execution boundaries.

**Controlled Run** keeps the coding agent working inside those boundaries while MartinLoop tracks attempts, cost, stop conditions, and recovery state.

**Verified Handoff** closes the loop with one authoritative outcome:

- `VERIFIED` when the configured evidence supports the Definition of Done
- `STOPPED` when a configured hard boundary ends the run
- `NEEDS REVIEW` when completion cannot be established from the available evidence

The handoff can include verifier steps, scope state, attempt count, cost provenance, unresolved evidence, recovery state, receipt integrity, and the next safe action. The exact fields depend on what the run actually established.

## Visual Proof

MartinLoop turns an AI coding run into an inspectable execution record: budget used, verifier result, changed files, rollback evidence, and final receipt.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/cli-animated.svg" alt="MartinLoop CLI showing a governed agent run" width="720">
</div>

Ungoverned agents can retry until cost and scope drift. MartinLoop adds budget caps, verifier gates, and audit evidence so the run has a clear stop condition.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/side-by-side.svg" alt="MartinLoop governed run compared with an unbounded retry loop" width="720" height="1080">
</div>

## MartinLoop Arcade

Long governed runs do not have to mean staring at a spinner. In an interactive terminal, MartinLoop Arcade can be offered while the coding agent continues working in the background.

Arcade is presentation-only. It cannot change the agent, budget, verifier, policy decision, run outcome, or receipt evidence. It stays out of JSON, CI, non-interactive, and other machine-readable execution paths.

Use `--arcade` to offer Arcade immediately for a supported interactive run, or `--no-arcade` to suppress it for that run.

## Proof Receipts

Proof receipts are local share bundles for governed AI coding runs. They show the task, spend, budget, verifier result, receipt integrity, and any evidence boundary that should not be rounded into confidence.

This real governed run spent `$0.51` against a `$3.00` budget. The verifier passed and the receipt integrity was signed, but the proof stayed at `EVIDENCE_BOUNDARY` because rollback evidence was not recorded.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/proof-receipt-live-governed.png" alt="MartinLoop CLI proof receipt for a governed run with spend, budget, verifier, integrity, and evidence boundary" width="720">
</div>

Generate your own receipt after a governed run:

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@latest run "Summarize the demo workspace and prove tests still pass" --proof --verify "npm test"
npx -y martin-loop@latest runs verify --latest
npx -y martin-loop@latest share --latest
```

Example receipt files: [Markdown](./docs/examples/proof-receipts/live-governed-run-receipt.md) and [JSON](./docs/examples/proof-receipts/live-governed-run-receipt.json).

## Verify the Public Release Yourself

Use this lane from a clean temp directory to verify the public CLI flow exactly as shipped:

```sh
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 --version
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 start
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 demo
cd martin-loop-demo
npm install
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 run "Summarize the demo workspace and prove tests still pass" --verify "npm test" --budget-usd 2 --max-iterations 1 --json
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 dossier --latest --json
npx -y martin-loop@0.8.2 share --latest --json
```

For deterministic installs, pin the package line (`martin-loop@0.8.2`) or use `martin-loop@latest`. Plain `npx martin-loop` can resolve a stale local cache on some machines.

Expected share bundle outputs:

- `share/run-receipt.json`
- `share/run-receipt.md`
- `share/proof-card.svg`

## See It In Action

The point is not that every governed run is always cheaper. The point is that every run becomes inspectable and enforceable: budget policy, verifier result, stop reason, and evidence are explicit.

For a deterministic public repro lane, use the benchmark workspace and compare governed execution to unbounded retry behavior:

- `npx martin-loop bench --suite under-3-challenge`
- `npx martin-loop bench --suite ralphy-engineering-50`

## Ralph-Style Loops

A Ralph-style loop is the failure mode where an AI coding agent keeps trying without knowing when continuing is unsafe, uneconomical, or unlikely to succeed.

MartinLoop keeps the useful part of the loop, then adds brakes:

- stop before budget overspend
- classify unsafe or invalid actions before execution
- write an audit record for every attempt
- preserve rollback and verifier evidence for review
- reduce runaway context growth with compact run summaries

## Failure Taxonomy (13 Runtime Classes)

When a coding agent fails, "something went wrong" is not useful enough.

MartinLoop classifies runtime failures into 13 canonical classes so a failed run can tell you what happened, what needs attention, and what future runs can learn from.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/failure-taxonomy-13-classes.png" alt="MartinLoop failure taxonomy showing 13 runtime failure classes and why classification matters" width="900">
</div>

See the canonical table: [Failure Taxonomy (13 Runtime Classes)](./docs/oss/FAILURE-TAXONOMY-13.md).

## What It Does

- Budget caps stop the next attempt before a configured USD, token, or iteration limit is exceeded.
- Verifier gates require a real check, such as `npm test`, before a run can count as complete.
- Policy checks block unsafe verifier commands, risky path changes, and secret-like task inputs before execution.
- Failure classification uses canonical runtime classes for triage and reporting. See [Failure Taxonomy (13 Runtime Classes)](./docs/oss/FAILURE-TAXONOMY-13.md).
- Run receipts capture stop reason, verifier evidence, budget posture, integrity state, and the next safe action.
- `martin share --latest` turns the latest governed run into a local share bundle with a redacted JSON receipt, Markdown recap, and proof-card SVG.
- MCP integration gives hosts one write-capable execution entrypoint plus richer planning, inspection, and review helpers.

## How It Works

| Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Task contract | Objective, verifier plan, repo root, allowed paths, denied paths, acceptance criteria, workspace, project, and budget. |
| Policy and budget | Defaults come from `martin.config.yaml`; CLI flags can override them. Budget preflight blocks attempts that would exceed policy. |
| Agent adapters | Claude CLI, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and direct-provider adapters normalize execution results. |
| Safety and verification | Scope checks, verifier command checks, prompt integrity, and grounding decide whether work can continue. |
| Persistence | JSONL run records, evidence summaries, and repo-backed artifacts make every run inspectable later. Each loop record is locally signed (HMAC, per-runs-root key) and `dossier`/`runs get`/`runs verify`/`challenge`/`badge` report an `integrity` verdict (`verified` / `tamper_detected` / `unsigned`) so post-hoc edits to a record are detectable, not just inspectable. |

## Trust Boundaries

- Cost and token outputs always include provenance (`actual`, `calculated`, `estimated`, or `unavailable`).
- For Codex specifically, MartinLoop reports authoritative usage only when the host exposes it; otherwise MartinLoop labels usage as estimated and avoids presenting it as settled accounting.
- Receipt integrity must be `verified` before a run is treated as trustworthy evidence for external review.

## Benchmarks

MartinLoop ships a public deterministic benchmark workspace in `benchmarks/` plus the installed-package `bench` command.

From an installed package:

```sh
npx martin-loop bench --suite under-3-challenge
npx martin-loop bench --suite ralphy-engineering-50
```

From a clean public clone:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm bench:build
pnpm bench:eval
pnpm bench:report:ralphy
```

Equivalent workspace-filter commands:

```sh
pnpm --filter @martin/benchmarks build
pnpm --filter @martin/benchmarks test
pnpm --filter @martin/benchmarks eval
pnpm --filter @martin/benchmarks report:ralphy
```

The installed-package command reads the shipped public fixtures. The repo-clone workflow runs the public benchmark workspace directly.

## MCP

Run the standalone MCP package directly:

```sh
npx -y @martinloop/mcp
```

Add it to common hosts:

```sh
codex mcp add martin-loop -- npx -y @martinloop/mcp
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user martin-loop -- npx -y @martinloop/mcp
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user martin-loop -- cmd /c npx -y @martinloop/mcp
```

Generate host config from the root CLI:

```sh
npx martin-loop mcp print-config --host codex --transport stdio --profile minimal
npx martin-loop mcp print-config --host claude --transport stdio --profile diagnostic
npx martin-loop mcp print-config --host gemini --transport stdio --profile full-local
npx martin-loop mcp print-config --host generic --transport stdio --profile github-review
```

The root `martin-loop` package, standalone `@martinloop/mcp` package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version are aligned at `0.8.2`. The MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.

The public MCP release train labels are:

- `0.1.4` operator foundation
- `0.2.0` cockpit expansion
- `0.2.5` public MCP package line
- `0.2.7` usability and review release
- `0.3.0` host adoption and onboarding release
- `0.3.1` review and handoff release
- `0.5.3` execution-control and host-compatibility release
- `0.5.5` governed-autonomous execution and proof-surface release
- `0.5.6` hosted run sync, fail-closed rollback, and verified-completion hardening

The standalone MCP registry/server identifier is `io.github.Keesan12/martin-loop`.

More detail: [MCP setup](./docs/getting-started/mcp.md), [MCP tool reference](./docs/reference/mcp-tools.md), and [MCP compatibility](./docs/reference/mcp-compatibility.md).

## SDK

```sh
npm install martin-loop
```

```typescript
import { MartinLoop, createClaudeCliAdapter } from "martin-loop";

const loop = new MartinLoop({
  adapter: createClaudeCliAdapter({ workingDirectory: process.cwd() }),
  defaults: {
    workspaceId: "my-workspace",
    projectId: "my-project",
    budget: {
      maxUsd: 3,
      softLimitUsd: 2.25,
      maxIterations: 3,
      maxTokens: 20_000,
    },
  },
});

const result = await loop.run({
  task: {
    title: "Fix auth regression",
    objective: "Fix the failing auth regression tests",
    verificationPlan: ["pnpm test"],
    repoRoot: process.cwd(),
  },
});

console.log(result.decision.status);
```

The root SDK also exports `createCodexCliAdapter`, `createGeminiCliAdapter`, `createDirectProviderAdapter`, and `createOpenAiCompatibleAdapter`.

## Telemetry & Privacy

MartinLoop sends minimal anonymous usage data to help improve reliability and prioritize development. On a fresh interactive install, telemetry is enabled by default but remains blocked until the one-time disclosure is shown. After the disclosure, the same run may send the allowlisted anonymous events unless you opt out.

**What is sent:**
- Random installation ID (generated locally, never linked to your identity)
- Per-process session ID
- CLI version, Node version, OS and architecture
- Event name and timestamp
- Command category, run duration, success/failure category
- Whether a receipt was generated; whether recovery occurred
- Opaque remote-experience ID/type after a click

**What is never sent:**
- Source code, prompts, task text, repository contents, file names, file paths
- Environment variables, secrets, provider/model output
- Receipt contents, ledger contents, approval details, verifier evidence
- Email addresses, workspace, project, or organization identifiers
- Raw exception messages or stack traces

**Endpoint:** `https://tupopqvqnyyjuxseyxkr.supabase.co/functions/v1/product-events`

**Headers sent:** `Content-Type: application/json`, `User-Agent: MartinLoop-CLI/<version>`

No authorization header, API key, or direct table access.

**Opt out anytime:**
```
martin telemetry off
```

**Inspect what is sent:**
```
martin telemetry explain
```

**Environment variables that disable telemetry:** `MARTIN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`, `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, `CI=1`

Set `MARTIN_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1` to print the telemetry envelope to stderr without transmitting it.

MartinLoop continues to work normally with telemetry disabled. No features are gated on telemetry consent.
