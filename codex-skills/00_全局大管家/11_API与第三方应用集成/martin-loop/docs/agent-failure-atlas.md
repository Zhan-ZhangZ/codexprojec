# Agent Failure Atlas

This atlas is a practical failure-mode catalog for governed AI coding runs. Each row is a reusable triage pattern: trigger, guardrail response, and where to confirm it in receipts.

The public canonical subset is the runtime 13-class taxonomy documented in [./oss/FAILURE-TAXONOMY-13.md](./oss/FAILURE-TAXONOMY-13.md). Legacy operational labels are replay-only aliases in [./oss/FAILURE-TAXONOMY-ALIASES.md](./oss/FAILURE-TAXONOMY-ALIASES.md). Use this atlas for the extended catalog.

| FL-048 | `rollback_restore_failed` | Restore action fails after unsafe change | Escalate with evidence | rollback artifacts |
| FL-049 | `replay_context_mismatch` | Verification replay uses mismatched workspace snapshot | Mark replay as non-comparable | replay notes/warnings |
| FL-050 | `evidence_link_missing` | Receipt references missing artifact path | Degrade trust and flag dossier | dossier warnings |
| FL-051 | `repo_readme_shadowed_by_dotgithub` | `.github/README.md` overrides root README on GitHub landing view | Block release until shadow file is removed | `public:readme-cta-guard` + repo contents |
| FL-052 | `receipt_gate_preflight_mismatch` | `preflight` reports success but the immediately-following governed `run` still says the preflight receipt is missing | Treat as a MartinLoop receipt persistence/lookup bug, auto-replay preflight if possible, and surface the exact objective/verify/cwd/runs-dir lookup tuple in debugging output | `policy_blocked` + `Governed run blocked until MartinLoop receipts exist for preflight` |

| FL-053 | `public_repo_direct_write` | Agent writes code directly to the public release repo instead of routing through the internal OSS staging repo first | Block commit via PreToolUse hook matching path; require all changes to be staged through the internal OSS staging repo before any public push; credential separation (session has no push access to public remote) is the load-bearing control | PreToolUse hook exit code 2 + git credential scope |
| FL-054 | `credential_in_public_source` | API key, access token, or form ID hardcoded as a default fallback in public repo source code | Fail public surface scan; rotate the key regardless of whether the service calls it "public" (automated scanners flag all hardcoded keys as high severity); require env-var pattern with default documented in `.env.example` not source | `pnpm public:git-surface` + secret-pattern scan across all PR commits |
| FL-055 | `no_op_fix_committed` | Agent writes an empty or structurally inert code block (e.g. `if (condition) { /* comment only */ }`) and claims a bug is fixed | Require agent to show: (1) the actual failure path with file and line number, (2) that the fix intercepts that path, (3) a real run that reaches the next stage — all before any commit; "build passes" is not proof | receipt verification + real run output past the previously failing stage |
| FL-056 | `collapsed_evidence_claimed_as_verified` | Agent points to output that was never expanded or reviewed in the session as proof a fix was verified | Require agent to paste the specific lines in dispute before closing the fix; "it is in the diff I showed you" is not verification if the diff was not examined; bots finding real line-level issues in a PR is a strong signal the code exists — absence of bot findings on an empty diff is the tell | explicit line citation before commit approval |
| FL-057 | `unverified_regression_classification` | Agent labels a test failure as "regression" or "pre-existing" without running a bisection check — or gives two contradictory labels for the same failure in one response | Require `classify-test-failure.sh` output as literal JSON evidence before any classification is accepted in commit messages, PR descriptions, or incident reports. No evidence → status must be "unknown". | bisection JSON output |
| FL-058 | `revert_improvement_to_pass_stale_test` | Under pressure to fix failing tests, agent proposes reverting a hard-won diagnostic or correctness improvement in implementation rather than updating the stale test that encodes the old behavior | Before approving any change that makes implementation "simpler" or "shorter" to satisfy a test: ask explicitly whether the test is testing the right thing or just the old thing. If the implementation change was correct, the test is stale — update the test to assert the improved behavior, not the prior behavior. The smaller diff is not always the correct diff. See: session 2026-07-05, commit 6744c2b, claude-cli.ts diagnosticSummary incident. | code review gate: implementation regressions are never acceptable test fixes |
| FL-059 | `unidentified_hook_write_access` | A source file is modified between an Edit tool call's dispatch and its confirmation, with the responsible hook not identifiable from available hook source files — observed scope includes semantic test assertion rewrites and missing module export additions, not just formatting. See: session 2026-07-05, "file content has changed" errors on claude-cli.test.ts and index.ts export gap. | Follow-up needed: add timestamp + file-diff logging to every hook in `~/.claude/scripts/hooks/` that performs any write operation, so the responsible actor is traceable when this recurs. Until instrumented, treat any "file content has changed" error on a semantic file (not a generated or formatted file) as an incident requiring manual diff review before proceeding. | hook instrumentation: every write-capable hook must log file path, before-hash, after-hash, and timestamp |
| FL-060 | `lifecycle_hook_stdout_contamination` | npm lifecycle hook writes JSON to stdout during pack, contaminating the packed artifact manifest and breaking downstream consumers that expect clean stdout | Redirect hook output to stderr; add a stdout contract test that asserts pack output is valid JSON with no extraneous lines | session-2026-07-16 |
| FL-061 | `false_worktree_state_claim` | Agent reports repository or worktree state as clean, committed, or pushed without quoting the literal output of a freshly-run `git status --short` — untracked or modified files present while clean state is claimed | Require literal `git status --short` output in every state assertion; any non-empty output means state is not clean; reuse of prior tool results across context resets is not permitted | session-2026-07-17 |
| FL-062 | `implementation_outran_tests` | Production source files changed before a failing test covering the targeted behavior was committed; implementation and test written in the same commit or implementation committed first | Tests-first gate: commit a failing test before any production diff; never commit production code as the first change on a new behavior; document deviations with explicit rationale before making any production edit | session-2026-07-17 |
| FL-063 | `silent_persistence_failure` | Broad `.catch(() => {})` around writes, renames, or deletes in durability-critical paths; functions returning empty collections on filesystem error with no named event emitted; ledger counts incremented before the operation they record completes | All persistence errors must surface as named ledger events; `.catch(() => {})` is permanently banned in durability-critical paths; functions must return typed discriminated results distinguishing empty from error | session-2026-07-17 |
| FL-064 | `context_limit_local_only_exit` | Agent reaches context limit with uncommitted or unpushed code and no remote recovery checkpoint; session ends with local-only unverified changes and no handoff branch | At 80% context utilization push a named recovery branch (e.g. `recovery/session-YYYY-MM-DD`) before continuing; never let context reach the limit with local-only code; if limit is already hit, push before any further work | session-2026-07-17 |
| FL-065 | `hand_selected_release_surface` | Public promotion copies a remembered subset while newly added lockfile, test, or package-smoke files remain stale | Derive the full tracked release surface recursively; compare path and content hashes; require an exact reviewed divergence record for every exception | promotion manifest v2 + `verify-public-promotion` scenarios A-C |
| FL-066 | `tag_before_candidate_proof` | Release tags are created before the exact commit completes the full publisher-equivalent validation matrix | Bind an attestation to the candidate SHA and permit only one atomic root/MCP tag push after every command exits zero | pre-tag attestation + scenario F |
| FL-067 | `publisher_source_coordinate_mismatch` | Root and MCP publishers use different checkout rules, or a repair dispatch targets source different from existing tags | Require `HEAD == selected tag == paired tag == validated release SHA`; block stale/partial coordinates and reserve same-tag retries for infrastructure failures | release recovery state + scenarios D-E |

Use this atlas with `runs verify`, `dossier`, and `share` outputs to keep failure intelligence consistent across contributors.
