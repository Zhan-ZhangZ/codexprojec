# Martin MCP Release Map

This map defines the staged standalone MCP releases after the live `0.3.0` baseline. The point is to keep each release narrow, legible, and easy to validate.

## Live baseline

- public npm baseline: `0.3.1`
- public GitHub release baseline: `mcp-v0.3.1`
- in-repo release line: `0.3.2`
- next release to prepare after this cut: `0.3.3`

## `0.3.1` — Review And Handoff Controls

Story: make review, triage, and follow-through easier after a governed run finishes.

Include:
- stronger dossier and eval guidance
- clearer failed-run and publish-readiness flows
- compact review resources for what happened, what failed, and what to do next
- compact expected outputs for humans and agents

Do not include:
- hosted audit export
- org policy
- fleet controls
- evidence-dashboard claims

Primary public surfaces:
- `packages/mcp/README.md`
- `docs/oss/MCP-FOR-AI-AGENTS.md`
- `docs/release/MCP-0.3.1-RELEASE-NOTES.md`

## `0.3.2` — Engine Validation Hotfix

Story: fix a tool-input validation gap that rejected valid spend-limit requests for Gemini-backed runs.

Include:
- add `gemini` to the `engine` allow-list for `martin_run`, `martin_preflight`, and `martin_doctor`
- regression coverage for budget fields paired with `engine: "gemini"`

Do not include:
- new tools or schema fields
- opt-in execution controls
- changes to budget enforcement behavior

Primary public surfaces:
- `docs/release/MCP-0.3.2-RELEASE-NOTES.md`

## `0.3.3` — Opt-In Execution Controls

Story: widen control for power users without making execution feel implicit or invisible.

Include:
- explicit execution-capable profiles
- clearer refusal and escalation messages
- stronger docs for read-only versus execution-capable usage
- install snippets that make the safe default obvious

Do not include:
- hidden auto-execution
- hosted orchestration
- tenant or billing features
- non-OSS transport

Primary public surfaces:
- `packages/mcp/README.md`
- `docs/oss/MCP-FOR-AI-AGENTS.md`
- `docs/release/MCP-0.3.3-RELEASE-NOTES.md`

## Release cut rule

Before a public-prep branch opens:

1. Reconfirm `VERSION-LEDGER.md` against live npm and public GitHub.
2. Keep the changed-path set limited to the release in progress.
3. Run the full public release gates on the exact candidate commit.
4. Audit packed tarball contents, README, and release notes before publish.
