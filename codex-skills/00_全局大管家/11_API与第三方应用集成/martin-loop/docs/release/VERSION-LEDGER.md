## Release rules

- Live public baselines describe artifacts that actually exist. Do not cache mutable external registry values in this file; verify npm and registry state live during release close.
- The `0.6.7` train aligns the root package, standalone MCP package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version at `0.6.7`. MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.
- The `0.6.8` train aligned the root package, standalone MCP package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version at `0.6.8`. MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.
- The `0.6.9` train aligns the root package, standalone MCP package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version at `0.6.9`. MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.
- The `0.7.0` train aligned the root package, standalone MCP package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version at `0.7.0`. MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.
- The `0.7.1` train aligned the root package, standalone MCP package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version at `0.7.1`. MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.
- The `0.8.0` train aligned the root package, standalone MCP package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version at `0.8.0`. MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.
- The `0.8.1` train aligned the root package, standalone MCP package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version at `0.8.1`. MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.
- The `0.8.2` candidate aligns the root package, standalone MCP package, plugin metadata, and MCPB product version at `0.8.2`. MCPB manifest schema remains `0.3`.
- Do not infer standalone MCP release state from the root package, or the other way around.
- Public release notes must be written for customers and evaluators, not for internal operators.
- Public-facing examples, screenshots, README copy, and changelog entries must stay free of internal repo names, absolute system paths, private branch names, or process noise.
- Publish only through GitHub Actions trusted publishing / OIDC.
- A release is not complete until npm packages, GitHub releases, release assets, checksums, and applicable registry listings have been verified live.
